## üìö Overview

The **Kansas Frontier Matrix Glossary** is a **cross-domain reference** for developers, researchers, historians,  
and data scientists contributing to or using this repository.  

It aligns language across all MCP-compliant documentation and serves as a **knowledge interface**  
linking the project‚Äôs data architecture, workflows, ontologies, and CI/CD systems.  

This glossary is organized by category:
- üß± **Architecture & Infrastructure**
- üåé **Geospatial & Environmental Data**
- üß© **Metadata & Interoperability**
- üß† **Knowledge Graph & Semantics**
- üìú **Historical & Archival Concepts**
