## üìö Overview

This glossary serves as a **cross-disciplinary reference index** for contributors, researchers,  
and developers working on the Kansas Frontier Matrix.  

It consolidates terminology from:
- üß± **Architecture & CI/CD**
- üåé **Geospatial data systems**
- üß© **STAC & metadata frameworks**
- üß† **Knowledge graph ontology**
- üìú **Historical & archival documentation**

Every entry aligns with the **Master Coder Protocol (MCP)** principles of documentation-first reproducibility  
and provides links to related files or standards.
