# Glossary — Kansas Frontier Matrix (MCP Standard)

This glossary provides **canonical definitions** for cross-disciplinary terms used in the  
Kansas Frontier Matrix project. It unifies historical, cartographic, geological, archaeological,  
and computational vocabularies to ensure clarity across experiments, datasets, and workflows.

## Core Scientific & MCP Terms

- **Experiment (MCP)** — A structured research activity documented with Problem, Hypothesis, Method,  
  Variables, Data, Results, and Conclusion. Ensures reproducibility and transparency:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.  
- **Hypothesis** — A testable prediction framed as *If X, then Y*. Central to MCP experiment design:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.  
- **Independent Variable (IV)** — The factor manipulated in an experiment.  
- **Dependent Variable (DV)** — The factor measured in response to IV changes.  
- **Control Variable** — Constant factors held steady to reduce bias or confounding effects.  
- **Reproducibility** — Ability for an experiment to be independently repeated with the same results,  
  requiring documented methods, datasets, and configurations:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}.  
- **Uncertainty** — Degree of error or variability in measurement, interpretation, or model output:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}.
