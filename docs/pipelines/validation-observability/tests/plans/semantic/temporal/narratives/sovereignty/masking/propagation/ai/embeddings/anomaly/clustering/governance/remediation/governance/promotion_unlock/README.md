# 🔓🪶⏳ **Sovereignty Masking Propagation — Promotion Unlock Governance Test Plan**  
`…/promotion_unlock/README.md`

**Purpose:**  
Define the v11 governance test plan specifying **when and how** a previously blocked or quarantined model, dataset, pipeline, or narrative subsystem may be **safely re-enabled for promotion** *after* sovereignty, masking, ethics, lineage, documentation, and remediation requirements have been fully satisfied.

This plan guards the transition from **“blocked” → “allowed again”**, ensuring:

> *No unlock without full sovereignty-safe, FAIR+CARE-valid evidence.*

</div>

---

# 📘 Overview

The Promotion Unlock Governance Test Plan confirms that:

- All prior sovereignty/masking violations have been **remediated**  
- All **clearance**, **validation**, **lineage update**, and **documentation** plans have passed  
- No residual drift, leakage, or governance gap remains  
- CARE-S Sovereignty Council and FAIR+CARE Council have explicitly approved re-enablement  
- Promotion Gate v11 can move from **hard BLOCK** to **normal gating** only when the unlock criteria are met  
- Unlock operations themselves are fully documented and provenance-tracked  

Promotion unlock is the **final, cautious step**: the system moves from remediation back into normal operation.

# 🧩 Promotion Unlock Governance Domains (Mandatory)

All **11** domains must pass before any unlock.

---

## 1. ✅ Prerequisites Check

Ensures:

- Remediation completeness plan passed  
- Required artifacts completeness plan passed  
- Documentation remediation & lineage plans passed  
- Clearance (FAIR+CARE + CARE-S) & validation plans passed  

No unlock can proceed if **any** prerequisite governance test-plan is failing or incomplete.

---

## 2. 🪶 Sovereignty Sign-Off (CARE-S)

Ensures:

- CARE-S Sovereignty Council explicitly approves re-enablement  
- Sovereignty risk is considered acceptable after remediation  
- Tribal/Indigenous authority-to-control is satisfied  

**Missing or negative CARE-S sign-off → IMMEDIATE BLOCK**

---

## 3. 🧘 FAIR+CARE Re-Approval

Ensures:

- FAIR+CARE Council reconfirms ethical compliance  
- No new harms introduced by remediation changes  
- Governance alignment with FAIR/CARE principles  

---

## 4. 🛡 Masking State Verification

Ensures:

- All masking systems (graph, spatial H3, temporal abstraction, identity, embeddings, clusters, narratives) are in a fully restored state  
- No residual unmasked fields remain  

---

## 5. 🧬 Lineage Update Verification

Ensures:

- Lineage update plan completed successfully  
- Old unsafe lineage removed or archived  
- New lineage graphs & OpenLineage events valid and sovereignty-safe  

---

## 6. 📜 Documentation & Metadata Alignment

Ensures:

- Governance documentation lineage & remediation docs match runtime state  
- STAC/DCAT metadata aligned with corrected masking & sovereignty rules  

---

## 7. 🌀 Drift Stability Check

Ensures:

- No active drift trend threatening a new violation  
- Drift metrics fall back under governance thresholds  

---

## 8. 📚 Story Node v3 Narrative Unlock Checks

Ensures:

- SNv3 outputs in test mode show no sovereignty violations  
- Narrative masking rules correctly enforced  
- No residual contaminated content  

---

## 9. 🧠 Focus Mode v3 Reasoning Unlock Checks

Ensures:

- FMv3 reasoning outputs in test mode remain compliance-safe  
- No hidden routes to sovereignty breaches via reasoning chains  

---

## 10. ♻ Telemetry & Sustainability Post-Remediation

Ensures:

- Telemetry signals (energy, carbon, runtime) are stable  
- No lingering anomalies that might signal hidden issues  

---

## 11. 🚦 Promotion Gate v11 — Unlock Criteria

Promotion unlock requires:

- All above domains pass  
- No unresolved warnings or escalations  
- Unlock event documented, provenance-recorded, and timestamped  
- Gate transitions from “**Forced Block**” back to “**Normal Gated**” state  

**Any failed domain → Unlock refused, Promotion Gate remains BLOCKED.**

# 🛠 Example Promotion Unlock Config

```yaml
sovereignty_promotion_unlock_plan:
  version: "v11.0.0"
  required_domains:
    - prerequisites_check
    - sovereignty_signoff
    - faircare_signoff
    - masking_state_verification
    - lineage_update_verification
    - documentation_alignment
    - drift_stability
    - narrative_unlock
    - focusmode_unlock
    - telemetry_sustainability
    - promotion_gate

thresholds:
  care_s_violation: false
  require_all_prereqs_passed: true
  require_prov_chain: true
  require_stac_dcat_alignment: true
  require_no_active_drift_alarms: true
```

---

# 🧪 CI Integration

Executed by:

- `promotion-unlock-governance-testplan.yml`
- `remediation-prereq-check.yml`
- `sovereignty-signoff-validation.yml`
- `faircare-reapproval-check.yml`
- `masking-state-verification.yml`
- `lineage-update-verification.yml`
- `documentation-alignment-check.yml`
- `drift-stability-governance.yml`
- `storynode-v3-unlock-safety.yml`
- `focusmode-unlock-safety.yml`
- `telemetry-post-remediation.yml`
- `model-promotion-gate.yml`

Any failure results in:

- **Unlock denied**  
- **System remains in blocked/remediation mode**  
- **CARE-S + FAIR+CARE review required**
