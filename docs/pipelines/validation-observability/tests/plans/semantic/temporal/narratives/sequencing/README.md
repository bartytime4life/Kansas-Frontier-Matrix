# 🔗⏳ **Semantic Temporal-Narrative Sequencing Governance Test Plan**  
`docs/pipelines/validation-observability/tests/plans/semantic/temporal/narratives/sequencing/README.md`

**Purpose:**  
Guarantee that all narrative event sequences—generated by **Story Node v3**, **Focus Mode v3**, **ETL/AI pipelines**, and **observability dashboards**—follow **correct, evidence-backed**, **OWL-Time aligned**, **sovereignty-safe** chronological order, and never hallucinate, reorder, or distort event chains.

</div>

---

# 📘 Overview

This test plan enforces:

- Correct ordering of historical events  
- No fabricated or speculative narrative sequences  
- OWL-Time temporal logic (before/after/overlaps/meets)  
- CARE-S sovereignty protection for cultural/tribal timelines  
- Cross-event sequencing grounded in validated dataset/graph provenance  
- Narrative stability under drift (embedding, semantic, spatial, temporal)  
- Story Node v3 sequencing block correctness  
- Focus Mode v3 reasoning path sequencing coherence  
- STAC/DCAT temporal extents aligned with narrative sequences  
- Promotion Gate v11 receives complete event-ordering integrity signals  

**Any sequencing failure → promotion BLOCKED.**

# 🧩 Temporal-Narrative Sequencing Governance Domains (Mandatory)

All **10 domains** must pass.

---

## 1. 🧬 OWL-Time Relation Validity  
Ensures event sequence semantics match:

- `time:before`  
- `time:after`  
- `time:intervalMeets`  
- `time:intervalOverlaps`  

**Fail → BLOCK**

---

## 2. 🔗 Event Ordering Integrity  
Checks:

- No reversed orderings  
- No invented events inserted into sequences  
- No collapse/merge of distinct events  
- Sequence matches KG canonical chronology  

**Fail → BLOCK**

---

## 3. 🧠 Causal Path Legitimacy  
Validates:

- Causal chains exist only where documented  
- No fabricated cause/effect narratives  
- No inference beyond provable relationships  

**Fail → BLOCK**

---

## 4. 🪶 CARE-S Cultural/Tribal Sequencing Safety  
Critical domain.

Blocks:

- Invented tribal-history event orders  
- Mis-sequenced heritage narratives  
- Unauthorized linking of cultural events  
- Exposure of protected ceremonial sequences  

**Any CARE-S violation → IMMEDIATE BLOCK**

---

## 5. 🌀 Drift-Induced Sequence Distortion  
Detects:

- Temporal drift leading to reordered events  
- Embedding/semantic drift warping causal paths  
- Unstable ordering across model versions  

**Fail → BLOCK**

---

## 6. 📚 Story Node v3 Sequencing Correctness  
Ensures:

- SNv3 lists event sequences with valid ordering  
- Citations back each sequence segment  
- JSON-LD → OWL-Time expansion valid  

**Fail → BLOCK**

---

## 7. 🧠 Focus Mode v3 Reasoning Sequence Safety  
Checks:

- FMv3 multi-step reasoning does not hallucinate sequences  
- No causal leaps or fabricated transitions  
- Reasoning grounded in KG temporal edges  

**Fail → BLOCK**

---

## 8. 🌐 STAC/DCAT Sequence Metadata Alignment  
Ensures:

- Dataset temporal extents match narrative sequence ranges  
- FAIR+CARE compliance for sequence metadata  
- No mismatch between metadata and narrative ordering  

**Fail → BLOCK**

---

## 9. 🧾 PROV-O Sequence Provenance  
Validates:

- Sequence-generating Activities timestamped  
- All Entities linked to verifiable temporal sources  
- No inconsistent or circular provenance  

**Fail → BLOCK**

---

## 10. 🚦 Promotion Gate v11 — Sequencing Criteria  
Promotion requires:

- Accurate chronological sequencing  
- No CARE-S violations  
- No drift-induced distortions  
- Full provenance + STAC/DCAT alignment  
- Stable Story Node v3 + Focus Mode v3 behavior  

**ANY failure → Promotion BLOCKED**

---

# 🛠 Example Sequencing Config

```yaml
semantic_temporal_narrative_sequencing_plan:
  version: "v11.0.0"
  required_domains:
    - owl_time

    - causal_paths
    - cultural
    - drift
    - storynode_v3
    - focus_mode_v3
    - stac_dcat
    - prov_o
    - promotion_gate

  care_s_violation: false
  require_prov_chain: true
  require_stac_dcat_alignment: true
```

# 🧪 CI Integration

Executed by:

- `semantic-temporal-narrative-sequencing-testplan.yml`
- `owl-time-schema-check.yml`
- `storynode-v3-temporal-check.yml`
- `ai-lineage-testplan.yml`
