# 📚🪶⏳ **Sovereignty Masking Propagation — Documentation, Clearance, Completeness & Masking Alignment Test Plan**  
`semantic/temporal/narratives/sovereignty/masking/propagation/ai/embeddings/anomaly/clustering/governance/remediation/governance/documentation/clearance/completeness/cross_references/entities/graph_resolution/existence/masking_alignment/README.md`

**Purpose:**  
Define the v11 **governance test plan** that guarantees **all documentation, clearance records, cross-references, graph-entity resolutions, and masking-alignment checks** surrounding sovereignty masking propagation are **complete, consistent, provable, and CARE-S–compliant** across KFM.

This plan ensures that what KFM *documented* as masked, sovereign-protected, or abstracted is exactly what the **graphs, embeddings, clusters, narratives, and pipelines actually enforce**.

</div>

---

# 📘 Overview

This test plan verifies that:

- All sovereignty masking decisions are **fully documented**, **clearance-tracked**, and **cross-referenced**  
- Graph entities marked as protected remain masked in all semantic views  
- Documentation and reality (graph + embeddings + clusters + narratives) are **perfectly aligned**  
- No protected entity exists unmasked in any derived representation  
- No cluster or anomaly model contradicts documented masking policies  
- All Story Node v3 / Focus Mode v3 outputs respect the documented masking alignment  
- STAC/DCAT + PROV-O + OpenLineage metadata support sovereign masking alignment  
- Promotion Gate v11 uses **documentation-aware governance** (nothing can be promoted unless fully documented & aligned)

Any misalignment between **docs, graph, and masking behavior** → **Promotion BLOCKED**.

# 🧩 Masking-Alignment Governance Domains (Mandatory)

All **10 domains** must pass.

---

## 1. 📚 Documentation Completeness

Ensures:

- All sovereignty masking rules are documented  
- All sensitive entities and datasets have explicit entries  
- All masking policies include scope (temporal, spatial, narrative, embedding)  

**Fail → BLOCK**

---

## 2. ✅ Clearance Workflow Integrity

Validates:

- All masking decisions approved by appropriate governance roles (CARE-S/FAIR+CARE)  
- No undocumented overrides  
- All clearance decisions PROV-O tracked  

**Fail → BLOCK**

---

## 3. 🔁 Cross-Reference Consistency

Ensures:

- No contradictions between README docs, YAML configs, schemas, and governance policies  
- Every referenced entity/ID exists and matches graph records  

**Fail → BLOCK**

---

## 4. 🧬 Entity Marking & KG Flags

Checks:

- Graph entities (persons, places, sites, narratives, datasets) have correct sensitivity flags  
- Entity annotations match governance docs  
- No sensitive entity missing a sovereignty/masking flag  

**Fail → BLOCK**

---

## 5. 🕸 Graph Resolution & Existence Checks

Ensures:

- Direct graph queries cannot discover unmasked sensitive entities  
- No “dangling” or hidden nodes that escape masking  
- Entity existence tests respect masking states  

**Fail → BLOCK**

---

## 6. 🎯 Masking Alignment (Docs ↔ Behavior)

Core domain.

Validates:

- Everything documented as masked is actually masked (spatial, temporal, narrative, embedding)  
- Nothing masked in code/graphs is undocumented in governance docs  
- No divergence between intended and implemented masking behavior  

**Any divergence → PROMOTION BLOCKED**

---

## 7. 🌐 STAC/DCAT Documentation & Metadata Alignment

Ensures:

- Dataset licensing, rights, sensitivity, and sovereignty fields match governance documentation  
- No dataset documented as “restricted” appears as “open” or vice versa  

**Fail → BLOCK**

---

## 8. 🧾 PROV-O Provenance for Masking Decisions

Ensures:

- All masking decisions have provenance entries:  
  - which Agent made them  
  - what Activity updated masking flags  
  - which Entities were affected  
- No undocumented change of masking state  

**Fail → BLOCK**

---

## 9. 🧠 Narrative & Embedding Alignment Hooks

Ensures:

- Story Node v3 and Focus Mode v3 consult and obey documentation-driven masking rules  
- Embedding pipelines read sensitivity flags sourced from documented governance  
- No narrative or embedding output can diverge from governance docs  

**Fail → BLOCK**

---

## 10. 🚦 Promotion Gate v11 — Documentation & Alignment Criteria

Promotion requires:

- Documentation completeness ≥ 100% for all sovereignty-related masking  
- All KG entities consistent with docs  
- All STAC/DCAT metadata consistent with docs  
- All PROV-O masking provenance complete  
- All narrative + embedding behaviors in perfect alignment  

**ANY mismatch → Promotion BLOCKED**

---

# 🛠 Example Alignment Config

```yaml
sovereignty_masking_alignment_plan:
  version: "v11.0.0"
  required_domains:
    - documentation_completeness
    - clearance_workflow
    - cross_references
    - entity_marking
    - graph_resolution
    - existence_checks
    - masking_alignment
    - stac_dcat
    - prov_o
    - promotion_gate

thresholds:
  doc_completeness_required: 1.0
  allow_unmarked_sensitive_entities: false
  allow_alignment_divergence: false
  care_s_violation: false
  require_prov_chain: true
  require_stac_dcat_alignment: true
```

---

# 🧪 CI Integration

Executed by:

- `sovereignty-masking-alignment-testplan.yml`  
- `governance-docs-testplan.yml`  
- `kg-entity-sensitivity-check.yml`  
- `stac-dcat-sensitivity-alignment.yml`  
- `prov-masking-lineage-audit.yml`  
- `focusmode-governance-alignment.yml`  
- `storynode-v3-masking-alignment.yml`  
- `model-promotion-gate.yml`

Any failure:

- **BLOCKS promotion**  
- Triggers CARE-S + FAIR+CARE governance review  
- Requires documentation and masking realignment
