# 🧊🌀⏳  
# **Cluster Stability Governance Test Plan**  
`…/anomaly/clustering/stability/README.md`

**Purpose:**  
Define the v11 governance test plan ensuring that **cluster stability**—how clusters shift, evolve, distort, fragment, merge, or drift—never produces:

- sovereignty leaks  
- latent cultural group reconstruction  
- identity inference  
- narrative distortion  
- unmasked spatial or temporal alignment  
- cluster drift that reintroduces sensitive patterns  

Cluster stability is a **core sovereignty-safety requirement**.

</div>

---

# 📘 Overview

This governance plan ensures:

- Clusters remain **consistent**, **non-revealing**, **non-aligned** with tribal/heritage patterns  
- No drift-based cluster changes expose sensitive groups  
- No sudden cluster instability caused by embedding drift, retraining, or regeneration  
- No merging or splitting events that recreate protected cultural boundaries  
- Story Node v3 and Focus Mode v3 remain safe under evolving cluster structures  
- STAC/DCAT metadata stays aligned with cluster definitions  
- OpenLineage + PROV-O lineage updates captured for all cluster evolution  
- Promotion Gate v11 blocks unsafe or unstable cluster states  

Cluster stability governance protects KFM from latent-space volatility that could undermine masking.

# 🧩 Cluster Stability Governance Domains (Mandatory)

All **12** domains must pass.

---

## 1. 🧊 Centroid Drift Safety  
Ensures:

- Centroid movement over time remains under governance thresholds  
- No drift that recreates cultural/tribal groupings  

---

## 2. 🌀 Boundary Drift Governance  
Ensures:

- Cluster boundary expansion/contraction cannot reveal sensitive structure  
- No boundary shift that aligns with protected sites or time periods  

---

## 3. 🔀 Fragmentation Safety  
Ensures:

- Splitting clusters cannot isolate protected cultural entities  
- No micro-clusters that correlate with sovereignty-restricted groups  

---

## 4. 🔗 Merging Safety  
Ensures:

- Cluster merges cannot imply aggregation of tribal/heritage signals  
- No fused cluster representing a sovereign group  

---

## 5. 📉 Volatility Controls  
Ensures:

- High-variance cluster metrics are flagged  
- No oscillation between “safe” and “unsafe” cluster structures  

---

## 6. 🪶 Sovereignty-Mask Alignment  
Ensures:

- Cluster structures remain compatible with spatial/temporal/identity/narrative masking rules  

---

## 7. 🧠 Embedding Instability Monitoring  
Ensures:

- Embedding drift cannot drive dangerous cluster reformation  
- Latent-space stability enforced  

---

## 8. 📚 Narrative Stability (Story Node v3)  
Ensures:

- SNv3 narratives remain stable and unaffected by cluster drift  
- No narrative oscillations implying cultural movement  

---

## 9. 🧠 Narrative Stability (Focus Mode v3)  
Ensures:

- FMv3 reasoning unaffected by cluster pattern volatility  
- No re-introduction of cultural inference pathways  

---

## 10. 🚨 Anomaly Stability  
Ensures:

- Cluster drift does not distort anomaly detection  
- No new anomaly clusters dominated by protected identities  

---

## 11. 🌐 STAC/DCAT Metadata Stability  
Ensures:

- Metadata remains aligned when cluster definitions evolve  
- No contradictory spatial/temporal/sensitivity fields  

---

## 12. 🚦 Promotion Gate v11 — Stability Criteria  
Promotion requires:

- Stable clusters  
- No drift-induced sovereignty risk  
- No volatility implying unsafe narratives  
- All lineage updated  
- FAIR+CARE + CARE-S sign-off  

**ANY violation → Promotion BLOCKED**
