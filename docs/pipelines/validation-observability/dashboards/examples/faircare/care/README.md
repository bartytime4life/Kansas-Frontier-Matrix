# 💜 **CARE Principle Observability Dashboard Examples (v11.0.0)**  
`docs/pipelines/validation-observability/dashboards/examples/faircare/care/README.md`

**Purpose:**  
Present example dashboards dedicated to **CARE Principle observability** across the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM) v11.  
These dashboards display ethical compliance, community-benefit alignment, sovereignty-authority enforcement, and responsibility/ethics metrics used in governance reviews.

</div>

---

# 📘 Overview

CARE observability dashboards reveal:

- **Collective Benefit** indicators and equity scoring  
- **Authority to Control** and sovereignty-aligned decision surfaces  
- **Responsibility** logs, stewardship actions, and data handling checks  
- **Ethics** compliance metrics  
- CARE risk assessments across pipelines, datasets, entities, Story Nodes, and AI outputs  
- “CARE Impact Chains” reflecting responsible use of data  
- Sovereignty-sensitive redaction & masking adherence  

These examples provide **canonical, safe blueprint layouts** for CARE-aligned visualization.

---

# 🛡️ 5. Sovereignty-Aware CARE Dashboard Example

Includes:

- CARE metrics filtered by sovereignty-sensitive zones  
- Masking enforcement  
- Cultural data protection flags  
- H3 r7+ spatial protections  
- Temporal precision reductions  

Ensures CARE principles never conflict with sovereignty needs.

---

# ⚠️ 6. CARE Risk Dashboard Example

Shows:

- CARE risk score  
- Cultural-harm sensitivity  
- Ethical hazard indicators

- CARE lineage mapping  

Enables proactive mitigation.

---

# 🎨 Design Requirements (v11)

CARE dashboards MUST:

- Use respectful, neutral color palettes (purple, teal, sand)  
- Embed CARE principle labels & metadata  
- Use sovereignty-safe masking on all spatial/temporal outputs  
- Provide narrative contextualization & ethical explanations  
- Follow KFM Observability UI Style Guide v11  
- Achieve WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility
