# 🚀🔗 **Promotion Lineage Dashboard Examples (v11.0.0)**  
`docs/pipelines/validation-observability/dashboards/examples/lineage/promotion/README.md`

**Purpose:**  
Demonstrate **governance-safe, sovereignty-compliant dashboards** for visualizing lineage conditions required for *dataset promotion* from raw → staging → validated → promoted in KFM v11.

Promotion lineage dashboards enable governance councils to verify that **every requirement has been met**, including sovereignty, FAIR+CARE, and provenance closure.

</div>

---

# 📘 Overview

Promotion is the **final gate** in the KFM lineage lifecycle.  
These dashboards reveal:

- Promotion eligibility signals  
- Lineage closure readiness  
- Governance signatures & approval lineage  
- FAIR+CARE compliance thresholds  
- Sovereignty masking lineage satisfaction  
- Dataset rights, access-level constraints, and license propagation  
- AI-inference lineage prerequisites  
- Redaction & masking success/failure points  
- Cross-pipeline lineage reconciliation  
- Temporal & spatial lineage completeness  
- Story Node v3 & Focus Mode v3 narrative safety lineage  

Promotion can **never** occur until all lineage dimensions are complete and governance-verified.

# 🚀 1. Promotion Readiness Dashboard Example

Displays:

- Readiness scorecard  
- Promotion criteria checklist  
- FAIR+CARE scoring  
- Sovereignty compliance pass/fail  
- Lineage-closure completeness indicators  
- Required documentation completeness  

Used by reviewers to assess overall promotion viability.

---

# ⛔ 2. Promotion Blockers Dashboard Example

Highlights:

- Missing lineage segments  
- Masking/redaction lineage gaps  
- AI inference lineage failures  
- License/rights propagation errors  
- Temporal/spatial inconsistency flags  
- Governance signature gaps  
- CARE risk-level blockers  

If *any* blocker is present, promotion halts immediately.

---

# 🏛️ 3. Governance Approval Dashboard Example

Shows:

- FAIR+CARE governance approvals  
- Sovereignty board signatures  
- Ethics council decisions  
- Promotion validation logs  
- Multi-stage governance audit lineage  

Ensures promotion follows **full governance oversight**.

---

# 🛡️ 4. Sovereignty Promotion Dashboard Example

Includes:

- Sensitive-site spatial lineage validation  
- Temporal precision reduction lineage  
- Cultural-sensitivity approval signals  
- Redaction lineage finalization  
- Sovereignty-compliant metadata verification  

Promotion requires **sovereignty-first conformance**.

---

# 💜 5. FAIR+CARE Promotion Dashboard Example

Visualizes:

- FAIR principle compliance (F1–A1–I1–R1)  
- CARE principle alignment  
- Stewardship + ethics logs  
- Community impact scoring  
- Rights/authority lineage  

These must be satisfied *before* promotion.

---

# 🔗 6. Promotion Lineage Dashboard Example (Full Chain)

Tracks:

- Raw → processed → validated → promoted chain  
- PROV-O + OpenLineage merge/coherence  
- Entity/activity/agent chain closure  
- Masking + sovereignty lineage propagation  
- AI lineage → narrative lineage → dataset lineage integration  

Ensures a dataset’s entire lifecycle is **complete, justified, and approved**.

---

# 🎨 Dashboard Construction Requirements (v11)

All promotion lineage dashboards MUST:

- Integrate FAIR+CARE + sovereignty metadata  
- Display complete lineage closure with clear indicators  
- Use KFM Observability UI Style Guide v11  
- Provide WCAG 2.1 AA accessible visualizations  
- Mask sensitive coordinates & uncoarsened temporal precision  
- Provide explainability captions  
- Enable provenance tooltips for all lineage chain elements
