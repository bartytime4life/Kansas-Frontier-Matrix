# 🎛️ **AI Focus Mode v3 Observability Dashboard Examples (v11.0.0)**  
`docs/pipelines/validation-observability/dashboards/examples/ai/focus_mode/README.md`

**Purpose:**  
Provide example dashboards showing **Focus Mode v3 narrative reasoning**, **Story Node v3 grounding quality**, explainability overlays, sovereignty masking effects, CARE-compliant narrative scoring, and risk detection indicators.

These dashboards serve as official design references for **narrative AI observability** inside KFM v11.

</div>

# 📘 Overview

Focus Mode is KFM’s most sensitive AI subsystem.  
Dashboards here illustrate governed techniques for observing:

- Reasoning-path traversal  
- Narrative logic flow  
- Story Node v3 construction lifecycle  
- Grounding quality (temporal/spatial/semantic)  
- Sovereignty-driven narrative masking  
- CARE principle compliance  
- Uncertainty quantification  
- Narrative-chaining lineage (PROV-O)  
- Model drift or anomaly impacts on narrative generation  

Every visualization must remain **sovereignty-safe, explainable, auditable, and FAIR+CARE-aligned**.

# 🧠 1. Reasoning Flow Dashboard Example

Shows:

- Complete reasoning DAG for each Focus Mode invocation  
- Entity selection heatmaps  
- Rule-based vs neural explainability convergence  
- Narrative error detection signals  
- Story Node triggering pathways  

Used for narrative transparency & debugging.

---

# 📖 2. Narrative Alignment Dashboard Example

Monitors:

- Cross-entity narrative consistency  
- Internal contradiction detection  
- Out-of-context node injection  
- CARE & sovereignty suppression behavior  
- Narrative drift from data sources  

Ensures **story coherence and governance compliance**.

---

# 🕒 3. Temporal Reasoning Dashboard Example

Displays:

- OWL-Time interval reasoning  
- Temporal constraint validation  
- Temporal precision reduction indicators  
- Sensitive-era masking compliance  
- Time-window selection errors  

Guarantees **no sensitive temporal information** is exposed.

---

# 🗺️ 4. Spatial Reasoning Dashboard Example

Includes:

- MapLibre + H3-masked narrative spatial footprints  
- Spatial containment reasoning  
- Sensitive-site redaction overlays  
- Spatial lineage arrows  

Ensures spatial narrative safety.

---

# 🧩 5. Grounding Accuracy Dashboard Example

Tracks:

- Entity match quality  
- Semantic grounding scores  
- Canonical ID alignment  
- CIDOC-CRM mapping accuracy  
- Focus Mode ambiguity detection  

Guarantees Story Nodes match **real, lineage-backed entities**.

---

# ⚠️ 6. Narrative Risk Dashboard Example

Highlights:

- Sovereignty violation warnings  
- Bias / cultural harm flags  
- Low-confidence reasoning nodes  
- Narrative hallucination indicators  
- High-impact narrative-risk score  

Enables governance boards to approve or block narrative release.

---

# 🎨 Dashboard Construction Requirements (v11)

Focus Mode dashboards MUST:

- Use sovereignty indicators prominently  
- Embed FAIR+CARE compliance metadata in all panels  
- Mask temporal/spatial sensitive info (year/decade/era reduction, H3 r7+)  
- Offer full PROV-O lineage tooltips  
- Follow KFM Observability Style Guide v11  
- Meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility  
- Provide narrative-safe color palettes
