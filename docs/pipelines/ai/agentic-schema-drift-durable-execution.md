# 🤖 **KFM v11.2.2 — Agentic Schema Drift Steward & Durable Execution Integration**  
`docs/pipelines/ai/agentic-schema-drift-durable-execution.md`

**Purpose:**  
Describe how to integrate an **autonomous schema-drift maintenance agent** and **durable execution (Prefect + Pydantic AI)** into the KFM v11 stack so that ETL, STAC/DCAT metadata, Neo4j graph schemas, and Focus Mode narratives remain **self-healing, governed, and reproducible** under upstream schema changes.

</div>

---

## 📘 0. Context in the KFM Stack

Target architecture path:

- data  
  → ETL / LangGraph DAGs  
  → Neo4j  
  → APIs  
  → React + MapLibre + Cesium  
  → Story Nodes v3  
  → Focus Mode v3  

This guide introduces an **Agentic Schema Drift Steward** as a first-class v11.2.2 component, orchestrated by Prefect and optionally using LangGraph internally.

---

## 🧭 1. Why This Matters For KFM v11

KFM continuously ingests evolving sources:

- Hydrology & sediment datasets (USGS, USACE, DASC)  
- Climate normals & projections  
- Remote-sensing products (bathymetry, DEMs, geophysics)  
- Archival & heritage metadata (CIDOC-CRM, OWL-Time, GeoSPARQL)

When a **source schema drifts** (new fields, type changes, renames), the costs include:

- Broken ETL DAGs  
- Invalid STAC/DCAT metadata  
- Neo4j graph inconsistencies  
- Focus Mode narratives misaligned with reality  

External patterns show that we can:

1. Use an **agent** to detect schema drift and propose/implement safe changes instead of relying on ad-hoc manual fire drills.  
2. Wrap that agent in **durable execution** (Prefect) so failures resume from the last successful step instead of restarting entire workflows.

KFM’s need: a **self-healing, governed control-plane** for schema drift that is:

- Deterministic in interface  
- Durable and resumable  
- Observable and auditable  
- FAIR+CARE-aligned  

---

## 🧩 2. External Patterns (Mapped to KFM v11)

### 2.1 🧪 Autonomous Schema Drift Agent

Plain-English pattern:

- Upstream systems periodically change schemas (add/remove fields, rename, change types).  
- Pipelines break because the schema assumptions are stale.  
- An **agent**:
  - Monitors source schemas vs baselines.  
  - Diffs and classifies drift (added/removed/renamed/type-changed).  
  - Proposes migration plans and ETL/staging code patches.  
  - Reruns impacted pipeline segments after patching.

KFM Mapping:

- Monitor all **registered KFM collections**:
  - STAC Collections & Items  
  - DCAT datasets  
  - Neo4j schema (constraints, labels, relationships)  
  - Tabular schemas (KDW, external databases)  

- Introduce an **agentic “Schema Drift Steward”**:
  - Proposes STAC/DCAT field updates and schema evolution.  
  - Proposes ETL transformation patches (column mapping, type casting, renames).  
  - Generates Cypher migrations for Neo4j where needed.  

### 2.2 🧷 Durable Execution for Pydantic AI Agents (Prefect + Pydantic AI)

Pattern:

- AI agents are fragile (LLM timeouts, rate limits, network failures).  
- Pydantic AI gives **typed agents** with structured outputs.  
- Prefect adds:
  - Durable flows (resume from failure).  
  - Task-level retries, caching, timeouts.  
  - Observability & scheduling.

KFM Mapping:

- Wrap the **Schema Drift Steward** in a **Prefect flow**:  
  - Each LLM call or tool invocation becomes a Prefect task.  
  - Durable execution ensures we resume after partial failures.  
  - Telemetry & lineage are emitted for council review.

---

## 🧠 3. KFM v11 Agent Roles

We define two primary agents:

1. 🛰️ **Schema Drift Steward**  
   - Watches KFM sources (STAC, DCAT, Neo4j, tabular schemas).  
   - Detects & explains drift.  
   - Proposes & optionally applies migration patches.  
   - Emits PROV-O lineage and FAIR+CARE tags for each decision.

2. 🧪 **Transform Benchmarker**  
   - Evaluates multiple candidate transform strategies/models.  
   - Benchmarks:
     - Data quality (null rates, ranges, constraint violations).  
     - Model impact (if features feed ML).  
     - Runtime / cost.  
   - Outputs a **ranked, explainable recommendation**.

Both agents MUST be:

- Typed via Pydantic models.  
- Resumable via Prefect.  
- Governed (logged in governance ledgers, MCP-aligned).  
- Observable (OpenTelemetry + OpenLineage).

## 🧱 5. Reference Architecture for KFM v11

### 5.1 🔭 High-Level Flow

Conceptual stages for schema drift handling:

1. **Detection Layer (Non-AI, Deterministic)**  
   - Compare current source schemas (KDW tables, STAC Items, NetCDF, Neo4j schema) with baselines.  
   - Produce a `SchemaDriftEvent` document:
     - `source_id`  
     - `source_kind`  
     - `old_schema`, `new_schema`  
     - `change_diff`  
     - `severity` (`low | medium | high`)  

2. **Agent Layer (Pydantic AI + LangGraph)**  
   - Input: `SchemaDriftEvent`.  
   - Tasks:
     - Classify drift type (cosmetic / structural / semantic).  
     - Propose ETL transform patch.  
     - Propose STAC/DCAT updates.  
     - Propose Neo4j graph migrations.  
     - Emit explanations & risk notes.

3. **Execution & Governance Layer (Prefect)**  
   - Wrap agent in Prefect flows with:
     - Durable task execution.  
     - Retries, caching, timeouts.  
   - Steps:
     - Load baseline schemas & tests.  
     - Call Schema Drift Steward agent.  
     - Validate proposed patch against test suite.  
     - Apply patch in a **shadow environment**.  
     - Run focused subset of LangGraph DAG.  
   - If checks pass:
     - Promote patch to production.  
     - Emit telemetry & PROV-O lineage.  
     - Log governance decisions.

4. **Downstream Integration**  
   - Update:
     - STAC/DCAT collections.  
     - Neo4j schema and data.  
     - Focus Mode v3 narratives & Story Nodes describing schema transitions.

    from pydantic_ai import Agent

    schema_drift_steward = Agent(
        model="openai:gpt-4.1-mini",  # configurable in KFM
        name="kfm_schema_drift_steward",
        system_prompt=(
            "You are the Schema Drift Steward for the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM). "
            "Given a SchemaDriftEvent, propose a safe TransformPatch that preserves "
            "semantic meaning, respects FAIR+CARE, and minimizes breaking changes."
        ),
        result_type=TransformPatch,
    )

    # Example (inside a Prefect task):
    # patch: TransformPatch = schema_drift_steward.run(event)

### 6.3 Prefect Durable Execution Wrapper

    from prefect import flow, task
    from pydantic_ai.providers.prefect import PrefectAgent, TaskConfig

    prefect_schema_drift_agent = PrefectAgent(
        schema_drift_steward,
        model_task_config=TaskConfig(
            retries=3,
            retry_delay_seconds=30,
            cache_ttl_seconds=3600,
        ),
        tool_task_config=TaskConfig(
            retries=2,
            retry_delay_seconds=60,
            cache_ttl_seconds=3600,
        ),
    )

    @task
    def load_baseline(event: SchemaDriftEvent):
        # Load baseline schema, tests, and governance constraints
        # from KFM registries and Git/lakeFS ETL/repos
        ...

    @task
    def validate_patch(patch: TransformPatch, event: SchemaDriftEvent) -> PatchEvaluation:
        # Run unit tests, data quality checks, and targeted DAG runs
        ...

    @task
    def apply_patch_shadow(patch: TransformPatch, event: SchemaDriftEvent):
        # Apply patch in a non-production (shadow) environment
        ...

    @task
    def promote_patch(patch: TransformPatch, evaluation: PatchEvaluation):
        # Gated promotion with governance checks and approvals
        ...

    @task
    def emit_governance(patch: TransformPatch, evaluation: PatchEvaluation, event: SchemaDriftEvent):
        # Emit PROV-O, FAIR+CARE metadata, and telemetry bundles
        ...

    @flow(name="kfm_schema_drift_steward_flow")
    def kfm_schema_drift_steward_flow(event: SchemaDriftEvent):
        baseline = load_baseline(event)
        patch: TransformPatch = prefect_schema_drift_agent.run(event)
        evaluation = validate_patch(patch, event)
        apply_patch_shadow(patch, event)

        if evaluation.overall_recommendation == "accept":
            promote_patch(patch, evaluation)
        else:
            # Route to manual review / governance workflow
            ...

        emit_governance(patch, evaluation, event)

### 6.4 LangGraph Integration (Optional but Recommended)

Within the agent logic itself, use **LangGraph** to:

- Route between tools (STAC validator, DCAT validator, Neo4j schema inspector, telemetry summarizer).  
- Orchestrate multi-step reasoning.  

Prefect remains the **outer durable orchestrator**; LangGraph serves as the **inner reasoning fabric**.

---

## 📊 7. Benchmarking & Safety in KFM

KFM MUST maintain an **internal benchmark harness** for the Schema Drift Steward:

- Tasks:
  - Drift classification accuracy.  
  - Semantic mapping accuracy (e.g., `gage_height_ft` vs `water_level_m`).  
  - STAC/DCAT mapping correctness.  
  - Graph migration plan validity.  

- Metrics:
  - Accuracy against human-labeled gold sets.  
  - Number of unsafe patches caught by tests.  
  - Time-to-repair after drift events.  
  - Token/runtime cost for agent activity.  

- Safety Policies:
  - No auto-apply patches to production without:
    - Test suite passing.  
    - Governance checks (FAIR+CARE).  
  - High-severity drift requires **human approval** even if tests pass.

---

## 🧭 8. Focus Mode v3 & Story Node Integration

Schema drift events become **first-class knowledge**:

- Story Node v3 examples:
  - “How KFM adapted to the 2025 Kansas River bathymetry schema change.”  
  - “How climate normal fields were harmonized in the 2025 refresh.”

- Focus Mode v3 uses:
  - Drift events as timeline overlays.  
  - Patch IDs as anchors: KFM-SCHEMA-2025-11-003.  
  - Context: “Interpretation changes at this point due to schema updates.”

Implementation pattern in `emit_governance`:

- Write a **concise narrative summary** of each accepted patch.  
- Link to:
  - Telemetry bundle.  
  - PROV chain for the impacted dataset.  
  - Prefect run ID and agent model version.  
- Register a Story Node entry that Focus Mode can include in narratives.

---

## ⚖️ 9. Governance, Telemetry, FAIR+CARE Hooks

The Schema Drift Steward & Transform Benchmarker are **governed AI components**:

- **MCP-DL v6.3**  
  - Flows registered in governance ledgers.  
  - Required metadata:
    - agent_name, agent_version  
    - model_name, model_version  
    - tools used  
    - Pydantic schemas for inputs/outputs  

- **Telemetry**  
  - Per-run telemetry bundle:
    - `drift_event_id`  
    - `chosen_patch_id`  
    - Evaluation metrics  
    - Prefect flow/task IDs  
    - LangGraph run ID (if used)  
    - `energy.kwh_estimate`, `carbon.gco2e_estimate`  

- **FAIR+CARE**  
  - System prompts and tools MUST:
    - Preserve data context and meaning.  
    - Protect sensitive heritage locations (H3 generalization).  
    - Respect tribal and community governance.  

- **Neo4j / PROV-O**  
  - Each patch is a `prov:Activity` linking:
    - Old and new dataset versions.  
    - Agents (software + human) involved.  
    - Governance decisions (manual overrides, council votes).

---

## 🕰 10. Rollout Plan for KFM v11

Recommended rollout:

1. 🥽 **Phase 0 — Observation Only**  
   - Build Schema Drift Detector emitting `SchemaDriftEvent` objects.  
   - No agents; only dashboards and alerts.

2. 🧪 **Phase 1 — Propose-Only Agent**  
   - Run Schema Drift Steward to create `TransformPatch` proposals.  
   - Do not apply; compare with human patches; benchmark.

3. 🌓 **Phase 2 — Shadow Apply**  
   - Apply patches only in **shadow environments**.  
   - Run focused DAG + Focus Mode story subsets to detect regressions.

4. 🚦 **Phase 3 — Gated Auto-Apply**  
   - Auto-apply low-risk patches that:
     - Pass tests.  
     - Have strong evaluation metrics.  
     - Affect non-sensitive data.  
   - Medium/high-risk drift stays manual.

5. 🌐 **Phase 4 — Full Platform Integration**  
   - Integrate with:
     - KFM validation dashboards.  
     - Story Node v3 / Focus Mode v3.  
     - All relevant STAC/DCAT collections & Neo4j schemas.
