# 🧾 **Kansas Frontier Matrix — Governance & Audit Ledgers Index**
`docs/reports/audit/README.md`

**Purpose:** Provide a comprehensive index for all governance and audit ledgers that track the lifecycle of validation, experiments, releases, and AI governance activities across the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
These JSON ledgers serve as KFM’s **immutable provenance layer**, guaranteeing accountability, reproducibility, and ethical compliance under **Master Coder Protocol (MCP v6.3)** and **FAIR+CARE** standards.

## 📘 Overview

The `docs/reports/audit/` directory defines all **governance and audit ledgers** generated through validation workflows, FAIR+CARE reviews, and AI model registration processes.  
Each record provides full **traceability**, **cross-referenced metadata**, and **SHA-256 verifiability** for every governance event across KFM releases.

All ledger entries are:
- Machine-readable JSON format  
- Timestamped and cryptographically signed  
- Referenced in release manifests and governance dashboards

## 🧩 Integration with Governance & Telemetry

All audit ledgers are referenced in:
- `docs/reports/telemetry/governance_scorecard.json`
- `reports/audit/github-workflows-ledger.json`
- `releases/v9.7.0/focus-telemetry.json`

These ensure synchronized **traceability** between validation, ethical governance, and telemetry systems.

**Governance Dashboard Sources:**
- `docs/reports/audit/governance-ledger.json`
- `docs/reports/audit/ai_models.json`
- `docs/reports/telemetry/governance_scorecard.json`

Displayed in:  
`web/src/components/DashboardView/`

|------------|----------------|
| **Findable** | Ledger entries indexed by dataset, model, or experiment ID. |
| **Accessible** | Stored in repository; publicly accessible under CC-BY 4.0. |
| **Interoperable** | JSON Schema aligns with DCAT 3.0 and schema.org. |
| **Reusable** | Timestamped, versioned, and checksum-verified entries. |
| **CARE** | Governance Council reviews all ledgers quarterly. |

## 🧾 Workflow Integration

| Workflow | Function | Ledger Output |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| `faircare-validate.yml` | Records FAIR+CARE validation outcomes. | `governance-ledger.json` |
| `stac-validate.yml` | Logs dataset schema validation. | `github-workflows-ledger.json` |
| `telemetry-export.yml` | Logs telemetry data and CI/CD metrics. | `release-manifest-log.json` |
