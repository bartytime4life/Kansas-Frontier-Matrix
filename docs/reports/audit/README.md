# 🧾 **Kansas Frontier Matrix — Governance & Audit Ledger Index**
`docs/reports/audit/README.md`

**Purpose:** Define the structure, purpose, and validation workflows of all audit and governance ledgers in the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
These ledgers form the **immutable provenance layer** of KFM — recording every validation, governance review, experiment, and AI model registration under **Master Coder Protocol (MCP v6.3)** and **FAIR+CARE** standards.

## 📘 Overview

The `docs/reports/audit/` directory defines and indexes all **immutable audit logs and governance records** generated during CI/CD validation, FAIR+CARE audits, and AI model registration.  
These JSON ledgers ensure full **traceability**, **accountability**, and **scientific reproducibility** across every KFM release.

Each entry is **machine-signed**, **timestamped**, and **cross-referenced** with:
- SPDX SBOMs (`sbom_ref`)
- Governance review metadata
- FAIR+CARE validation reports
- CI/CD telemetry (`telemetry_ref`)

**Dashboard Sources:**
- `docs/reports/audit/governance-ledger.json`
- `docs/reports/audit/ai_models.json`
- `docs/reports/telemetry/governance_scorecard.json`

Visualized in:
```
web/src/components/DashboardView/
```

| **Reusable** | Ledger data exported as part of each release for verification. |
| **CARE** | Every ledger entry reviewed by governance council for ethical compliance. |
