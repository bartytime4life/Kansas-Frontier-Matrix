# 📊 **Kansas Frontier Matrix — Reports & Validation Artifacts Index**
`docs/reports/README.md`

**Purpose:** Provide a centralized map for all generated reports, validation outputs, governance audits, and telemetry logs within the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM) monorepo.  
All artifacts documented here are **automatically produced**, **digitally signed**, and **FAIR+CARE** certified under the **Master Coder Protocol (MCP v6.3)**.

## 📘 Overview

The `docs/reports/` directory (and corresponding `/reports/` root) contains **machine-generated validation artifacts** from CI/CD workflows, FAIR+CARE audits, and governance activities.  
These files provide permanent, auditable evidence for **compliance**, **reproducibility**, and **operational performance** for each KFM release.

All reports:
- Are produced by GitHub Actions workflows.  
- Include SHA-256 checksums and version references.  
- Contribute to the **Governance Ledger** and **Telemetry Dashboard**.
