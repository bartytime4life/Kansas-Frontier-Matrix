# 📊 **Kansas Frontier Matrix — Reports & Validation Artifacts Index**
`docs/reports/README.md`

**Purpose:**  
Central map for **all generated reports, validation outputs, governance audits, and telemetry logs** within the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM) monorepo.  
All artifacts indexed here are **automatically produced**, **digitally signed**, and **FAIR+CARE** certified under **MCP v6.3**.

## 📘 Overview

The `docs/reports/` subtree (and the root-level `reports/`) contains **machine-generated validation artifacts** produced by CI/CD workflows, FAIR+CARE audits, and governance actions.  
These files form the **auditable evidence base** for **compliance**, **reproducibility**, and **operational performance** per release.

All reports:
- Are produced by GitHub Actions workflows.  
- Include **SHA-256** checksums and version references.  
- Feed the **Governance Ledger** and **Telemetry Dashboard**.

## ⚖️ FAIR+CARE Alignment

Each report reinforces transparent, traceable governance compliance:

| Principle | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **Findable** | Artifacts indexed by dataset/model/workflow IDs & timestamps |
| **Accessible** | CC-BY 4.0; public GitHub artifacts and catalogs |
| **Interoperable** | JSON/JSON-LD compatible with **DCAT 3.0** / **STAC 1.0** |
| **Reusable** | Timestamped, checksum-verified, version-tracked |
| **CARE** | Ethical reviews and council approvals recorded in ledgers |

---
