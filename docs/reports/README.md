# 📊 **Kansas Frontier Matrix — Reports & Validation Artifacts Index**
`docs/reports/README.md`

**Purpose:** Provide an overview and directory map for all generated reports, validation outputs, governance audits, and telemetry logs within the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM) monorepo.  
All artifacts documented here are **automatically produced**, **digitally signed**, and **FAIR+CARE** certified under the **Master Coder Protocol (MCP v6.3)**.

## 📘 Overview

The `docs/reports/` directory and its corresponding `/reports/` root directory contain **automatically generated validation outputs** from CI/CD workflows, FAIR+CARE audits, and governance activities.  
These artifacts serve as permanent, machine-readable evidence of compliance, reproducibility, and operational performance for each KFM release.

Every report:
- Is generated automatically by a GitHub Action workflow.
- Includes a SHA-256 checksum and version reference.
- Contributes to the **Governance Ledger** and **Telemetry Dashboard**.
