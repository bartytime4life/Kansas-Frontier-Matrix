# 📡 **Kansas Frontier Matrix — Telemetry & Performance Metrics Index**
`docs/reports/telemetry/README.md`

**Purpose:** Document the telemetry system, structure, and performance metrics generated by the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM) validation and governance workflows.  
Telemetry ensures transparency, reproducibility, and traceability across all automated systems — fully aligned with **Master Coder Protocol (MCP v6.3)** and **FAIR+CARE**.

## 📘 Overview

Telemetry in the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM) provides **automated performance monitoring, FAIR+CARE validation scoring, and workflow auditing**.  
Every CI/CD pipeline and AI process emits telemetry entries stored in both human-readable and machine-parseable JSON files under:

```
docs/reports/telemetry/
releases/v9.7.0/focus-telemetry.json
```

All telemetry data contributes to:
- **Governance Dashboards**
- **FAIR+CARE Compliance Audits**
- **AI Model Provenance and Drift Monitoring**
- **Build and Validation Runtime Metrics**

## 🧮 Telemetry Data Sources

| Source | Description | Workflow |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| **STAC Validation** | Records dataset-level schema validation metrics. | `stac-validate.yml` |
| **FAIR+CARE Audit** | Scores data governance and ethical compliance. | `faircare-validate.yml` |
| **Documentation Linting** | Tracks compliance of Markdown and YAML docs. | `docs-lint.yml` |
| **AI/ML Model Audits** | Measures performance and explainability outcomes. | `faircare-validate.yml` / `telemetry-export.yml` |
| **Build & Deploy Pipeline** | Captures duration, cache use, and artifact size. | `build-and-deploy.yml` |

---

## 🧾 Telemetry File Specifications

### 1. 🧠 `governance_scorecard.json`
Aggregates FAIR+CARE audit data, showing compliance levels across datasets, AI models, and governance workflows.

**Schema Example:**
```json
{
  "version": "v9.7.0",
  "timestamp": "2025-11-05T17:00:00Z",
  "fair": {
    "datasets_validated": 243,
    "passed": 238,
    "failed": 5,
    "compliance_rate": 97.9
  },
  "care": {
    "reviews": 12,
    "approved": 11,
    "pending": 1
  },
  "overall_score": 98.3,
  "notes": "FAIR+CARE metrics improved due to new dataset licensing updates."
}
```

**Generated By:** `.github/workflows/faircare-validate.yml`

---

### 2. ⚙️ `build_metrics.json`
Tracks system-level and workflow-level performance indicators for transparency and optimization.

| Metric | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `workflow_name` | Name of executed GitHub Action. |
| `duration_sec` | Total runtime in seconds. |
| `cpu_usage` | Percentage of CPU utilization. |
| `memory_mb` | Peak memory usage during build. |
| `cache_hit_rate` | Dependency caching success rate. |
| `artifacts_generated` | Count of artifacts uploaded. |
| `timestamp` | ISO timestamp of run completion. |

**Example Entry:**
```json
{
  "workflow_name": "stac-validate.yml",
  "duration_sec": 218,
  "cpu_usage": 73.4,
  "memory_mb": 1024,
  "cache_hit_rate": 0.86,
  "artifacts_generated": 3,
  "timestamp": "2025-11-05T18:30:00Z"
}
```

**Generated By:** `.github/workflows/telemetry-export.yml`

---

### 3. 🎯 `focus_telemetry_snapshot.json`
Captures the latest cumulative telemetry state used for AI-driven dashboards and public reports.

**Contents Include:**
- FAIR+CARE aggregate compliance scores
- AI model explainability audit summaries
- Workflow health and reliability metrics
- Dataset update frequency statistics

**Example Snapshot:**
```json
{
  "release": "v9.7.0",
  "overall_faircare_score": 98.3,
  "ai_models_reviewed": 7,
  "ci_success_rate": 100.0,
  "average_build_duration_sec": 310,
  "generated_on": "2025-11-05T20:15:00Z"
}
```

**Used By:**  
- KFM Governance Dashboard (MapLibre Admin View)  
- Focus Mode AI for data reliability assessment

---

## 🧩 Integration with Governance Ledger

Each telemetry update is cross-referenced in:
```
reports/audit/github-workflows-ledger.json
```

**Ledger Entry Example:**
```json
{
  "event": "telemetry_update",
  "workflow": "telemetry-export.yml",
  "run_id": 24819345,
  "status": "success",
  "timestamp": "2025-11-05T20:15:00Z",
  "telemetry_ref": "releases/v9.7.0/focus-telemetry.json"
}
```

Telemetry data are immutable and version-linked to the associated **SBOM (SPDX)** and **manifest** for cryptographic provenance.

---

## ⚖️ FAIR+CARE Alignment

| Principle | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Findable** | All telemetry files indexed and searchable by release tag. |
| **Accessible** | Publicly available under CC-BY 4.0 license. |
| **Interoperable** | JSON schema mapped to STAC/DCAT metadata for external integration. |
| **Reusable** | Retained per release for auditing and research reuse. |
| **CARE** | Reviewed for ethical and privacy compliance (no PII or sensitive data). |

---

## 🧠 Visualization & Dashboard Usage

Telemetry feeds into an interactive governance dashboard built on **React + MapLibre + D3**:  
- Displays FAIR+CARE scores geographically (per dataset region).  
- Renders performance graphs of validation pipelines.  
- Tracks CI workflow uptime and efficiency metrics.  

**Data Source:**  
```
docs/reports/telemetry/focus_telemetry_snapshot.json
```

**Dashboard Path:**  
```
web/src/components/DashboardView/
```
