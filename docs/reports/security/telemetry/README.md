# 📡 **Kansas Frontier Matrix — Security Telemetry Reports**
`docs/reports/security/telemetry/README.md`

**Purpose:**  
Repository of **runtime telemetry, environmental metrics, anomaly detection summaries, and energy compliance logs** that support Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM)’s FAIR+CARE and ISO 50001/14064 certification.  
Ensures verifiable monitoring of security, energy efficiency, and AI focus-mode behaviors under the Master Coder Protocol (MCP).

## 📘 Overview
This directory stores **security telemetry outputs and AI operational metrics** generated by automated pipelines and Focus Mode instrumentation.  
All logs are timestamped, validated against schema definitions, and included in the official governance ledger for transparency and accountability.

## ⚙️ Telemetry Pipeline Integration
| Component | Description | Source Workflow |
|------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Energy Metrics Collector** | Tracks power usage, CO₂ equivalent emissions, and renewable energy offsets. | `focus-telemetry-validate.yml` |
| **AI Focus Mode Logs** | Captures reasoning traces, explainability summaries, and ethical audit metadata for each Focus Mode session. | `ai-focus-audit.yml` |
| **System Monitoring** | Collects system performance and anomaly data via Prometheus exporters. | `telemetry-monitor.yml` |
| **Network Integrity Validator** | Records HTTPS/TLS checks, latency, and packet integrity between API and frontend. | `net-integrity.yml` |
| **Lifecycle Assessment (LCA)** | Aggregates total resource impact over build–deploy–operate lifecycle. | `sustainability-lca.yml` |

All telemetry data are hashed and cross-linked with the governance ledger and STAC/DCAT metadata catalogs for provenance.

## ⚖️ FAIR+CARE & ISO Compliance Mapping
| Standard / Principle | Metric Source | Verification Method |
|----------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **FAIR Principle – Accessible** | All telemetry files are versioned and linked in the manifest. | STAC/DCAT cross-index |
| **CARE – Responsibility** | AI model logs include ethical filters and anonymization. | FAIR+CARE validator |
| **ISO 50001** | Energy management system metrics. | Power usage and offset audit. |
| **ISO 14064** | Greenhouse gas emission logs. | Lifecycle (LCA) assessments. |
| **MCP-DL v6.3** | Documentation-first verification of telemetry pipeline. | Schema + CI workflow checks. |

---

## 🧾 Validation & Governance
Telemetry validation occurs through continuous integration workflows. Each commit triggers:
- **Schema Validation:** JSON Schema and SPDX verification.  
- **Checksum Validation:** SHA-256 digest comparison against SBOM.  
- **Governance Ledger Update:** New reports appended to FAIR+CARE audit chain.  
- **Energy Trace Export:** Synced to sustainability index for ISO 14064 compliance.
