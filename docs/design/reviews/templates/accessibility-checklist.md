## üìã Accessibility Review Purpose

The **Accessibility Review Checklist** serves as the official audit form used by the **UX & Accessibility Council**  
to evaluate whether all design assets, documentation, and web UI components meet **accessibility, inclusivity, and ethics compliance** benchmarks.

Each completed checklist must be:
- üßæ Stored in the **design review archive** (`docs/design/reviews/`).  
- üîè Logged in the **governance ledger** with checksum.  
- üß† Reviewed quarterly by the **FAIR+CARE Accessibility Committee**.
