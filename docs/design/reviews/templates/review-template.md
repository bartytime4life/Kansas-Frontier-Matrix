## üìã Purpose

This **Design Review Template** provides a reproducible structure for conducting quarterly UI/UX evaluations, ensuring  
each design component adheres to **FAIR+CARE**, **WCAG 2.1 AA**, and **MCP-DL** documentation standards.

Each completed review is stored under `docs/design/reviews/` and linked to:
- `data/reports/audit/ui_governance_ledger.json`
- `data/reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json`
- `reports/validation/design_validation.json`
