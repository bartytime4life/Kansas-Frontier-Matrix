# ü§ù **Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî FAIR+CARE Ethics Assessment Template (v2.1.1 ¬∑ Tier-Œ©+‚àû Certified)**  
`docs/design/reviews/templates/faircare-assessment-template.md`

**Mission:** Provide a standardized **FAIR+CARE ethical design and data assessment form** for evaluating  
Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM) datasets, interfaces, and AI-driven features through the lens of transparency, responsibility, and reproducibility.

## üìö Overview

The **FAIR+CARE Assessment Template** ensures all KFM systems adhere to ethical and open-science standards.  
It is used quarterly by the **FAIR+CARE Governance Council** to evaluate:
- Data stewardship and provenance.  
- Accessibility, inclusivity, and ethical representation.  
- AI fairness, transparency, and explainability.  
- Compliance with CARE principles for collective and cultural respect.  

Each assessment must be versioned, checksum-verified, and linked in the governance ledger (`data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json`).
