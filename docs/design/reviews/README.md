## üìö Overview

The **Design Review Archive** documents all accessibility and governance evaluations for KFM‚Äôs design system and interfaces.  
Each review ensures alignment with:
- **FAIR+CARE principles** for ethical and inclusive design.  
- **WCAG 2.1 / 3.0 standards** for accessibility.  
- **MCP-DL** governance for reproducible documentation.  

All records are cross-referenced with governance ledgers and stored permanently for provenance tracking.
