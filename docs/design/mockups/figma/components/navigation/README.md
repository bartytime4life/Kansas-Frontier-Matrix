# ðŸ§­ Kansas Frontier Matrix â€” Navigation Components  
`docs/design/mockups/figma/components/navigation/`

**Interactive Â· Temporal Â· Spatial Â· Accessible**

</div>

---

## Overview

The navigation system coordinates **time** (Timeline), **space** (Map + Layers), and **discovery** (Search + Detail Panel).  
Itâ€™s designed for clarity, speed, and accessibility, and is wired to the **API**, **STAC-driven layer configs**, and the **knowledge graph**.

Components

Component	Purpose	Notes
Header	Brand/home, global search, utility actions	/ focuses search; Help, Language, Auth
Timeline	Scrub/zoom/play time ranges	Emits {start, end} to filter map/layers
Layer Controls	Toggle overlays, opacity, legends	Groups by theme; STAC-derived config
Map View	Spatial context and interaction	Click markers â†’ open Detail Panel
Detail Panel	Dossier of entity/event	Summary, sources, related links

Event Contracts

Emitter	Event	Payload	Consumer	Effect
Timeline	time:changed	{ start, end }	Map	Filter events/overlays in view
Search	search:selected	{ entityId, type }	Map, Timeline	Zoom to entity; focus its time span
Map	map:entity:clicked	{ entityId }	Detail Panel	Open dossier with sources
Layers	layers:toggle	{ layerId, on }	Map	Show/hide + update legends
DetailPanel	detail:relation:selected	{ entityId }	Map, Timeline	Navigate to related item

Notes:
â€¢ All events should be typed in code and logged (dev mode) for traceability.
â€¢ Avoid tight coupling: use a central emitter/bus or React context to dispatch and subscribe.

Accessibility
	â€¢	Keyboard: Predictable Tab order; / focuses search; Esc closes panels; arrow keys in timeline.
	â€¢	ARIA roles: banner, search, navigation, main, complementary, region.
	â€¢	Timeline help: aria-describedby with short usage hints; ensure focus ring visible at all times.
	â€¢	Legends: Encode with shape/texture + color (WCAG 2.1 AA); provide text equivalents.
	â€¢	Contrast: Maintain AA minimums; test both light/dark themes.
	â€¢	Hit targets: â‰¥ 44Ã—44 px for touch.

Tech & Data

Subsystem	Tech	Purpose
Map	MapLibre GL JS	Rendering and spatial interaction
Timeline	HTML5 Canvas	High-density, high-FPS time rendering
Layers	STAC â†’ layers.json	Source URLs, time extents, legends
Knowledge	Neo4j	Entities, events, relationships
API	FastAPI / GraphQL	Search, details, aggregates

API / Event I/O (reference)
	â€¢	Timeline â†’ API: GET /events?start=YYYY-MM-DD&end=YYYY-MM-DD
	â€¢	Search â†’ API: GET /search?q=... â†’ { items: [{ id, type, title, timeSpan }] }
	â€¢	Detail â†’ API: GET /entity/{id} â†’ { summary, sources[], relations[] }
	â€¢	Layers â†’ STAC: GET /layers-config (layers.json) â†’ [ { id, type, url, time, legend } ]

Performance tip: Cache layers.json with immutable asset URLs; prefer COG/GeoJSON for streaming.

	â€¢	A11y check (keyboard, ARIA, contrast, focus states)
	â€¢	layers.json validated (schema + links)
	â€¢	E2E happy-path passes (search â†’ detail â†’ map â†’ time)
	â€¢	Event payloads are typed and logged (dev)

Notes for Maintainers

Keep this file GitHub-safe:
	â€¢	Quote all Mermaid labels containing punctuation.
	â€¢	End Mermaid diagrams with <!-- END OF MERMAID -->.
	â€¢	Use fenced code blocks for trees, tables, and commands.
	â€¢	When adding new components (e.g. Mini-Map, Bookmarks), update Components, Event Contracts, and A11y sections.
