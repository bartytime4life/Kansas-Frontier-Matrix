Overview

The Navigation system coordinates time (Timeline), space (Map + Layers), and discovery (Search + Detail Panel). It is designed for clarity, speed, and accessibility, and wired to the API, STAC-driven layer configs, and the knowledge graph.

Components

Component	Purpose	Notes
Header	Brand/home, global search, utility actions	/ to focus search; Help, Language, Auth
Timeline	Scrub/zoom/play time ranges	Emits { start, end } to filter map/layers
Layer Controls	Toggle overlays, opacity, legends	Groups by theme; STAC-derived config
Map View	Spatial context and interaction	Click markers â†’ open Detail Panel
Detail Panel	Dossier of entity/event	Summary, sources, related links

Event Contracts

Emitter	Event	Payload	Consumer	Effect
Timeline	time:changed	{ start, end }	Map	Filter events/overlays in view
Search	search:selected	{ entityId, type }	Map, Timeline	Zoom to entity; focus its time span
Map	map:entity:clicked	{ entityId }	Detail Panel	Open dossier with sources
Layers	layers:toggle	{ layerId, on }	Map	Show/hide + update legends
Detail Panel	detail:relation:selected	{ entityId }	Map, Timeline	Navigate to related item


â¸»

Accessibility
	â€¢	Keyboard: Tab focus order; / focuses search; Esc closes panels
	â€¢	ARIA roles: banner, search, navigation, main, complementary
	â€¢	Timeline has aria-describedby with short usage hints
	â€¢	Legends use shape/texture in addition to color (WCAG 2.1 AA)

Tech & Data

Subsystem	Tech	Purpose
Map	MapLibre GL JS	Rendering and spatial interaction
Timeline	HTML5 Canvas	High-density, high-FPS time rendering
Layers	STAC â†’ layers.json	Source URLs, time extents, legends
Knowledge	Neo4j	Entities, events, relationships
API	FastAPI / GraphQL	Search, details, aggregates
