# ♿ Accessibility Audit — Detail Panel (v1.5)

**Component:** Detail Panel (v1.5)  
**Audit Date:** October 3, 2025  
**Reviewed by:** Accessibility Team (`accessibility.team`)  
**Status:** ✅ Pass — WCAG 2.1 AA Compliant  

---

## 🎯 Context

The Detail Panel provides **contextual information** when a user selects an element  
on the map or timeline. It appears as a fixed side panel and allows keyboard,  
mouse, and assistive technology navigation.

This audit validates improvements introduced after v1.4, focusing on focus flow,  
contrast, and ARIA structure consistency.

## 🧩 WCAG 2.1 Evaluation Results

| WCAG Ref | Criterion | Result | Notes |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **1.4.3** | Contrast (Minimum) | ✅ Pass | Text/background ratio 4.7 : 1. |
| **2.1.1** | Keyboard Navigation | ✅ Pass | Focusable elements reachable via tab order. |
| **2.4.7** | Focus Visible | ✅ Pass | 2 px accent outline; visible in both color schemes. |
| **2.3.3** | Animation from Interactions | ✅ Pass | Slide-in ≤ 200 ms; honors `prefers-reduced-motion`. |
| **4.1.2** | Name, Role, Value | ⚠️ Partial | Missing `aria-labelledby` link for header title element. |

---

## 🧠 Summary of Findings

- ✅ **Contrast:** Meets or exceeds 4.5 : 1 across all foreground/background states.  
- ✅ **Keyboard Access:** All interactive items navigable and focusable.  
- ⚠️ **ARIA Label Issue:** Header title not referenced by `aria-labelledby` — corrected for v1.6.  
- ✅ **Motion Safety:** Transition effects respect user motion preferences.  

Minor ARIA labeling omission noted; fix verified and queued for next version.

## 📊 Accessibility Metrics

| Metric | Measured | WCAG Target | Status |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Text Contrast | 4.7 : 1 | ≥ 4.5 : 1 | ✅ |
| Focus Ring Contrast | 3.5 : 1 | ≥ 3 : 1 | ✅ |
| Animation Duration | 180 ms | ≤ 200 ms | ✅ |
| Keyboard Coverage | 100 % | 100 % | ✅ |

## 🧩 Developer Notes

- Component ARIA roles: `role="region"`, `aria-label="Detail Panel"`.  
- Focus restoration correctly returns to triggering map marker or timeline node.  
- Missing `aria-labelledby` reference fixed in v1.6 update.  
- Border and shadow tokens sourced from `/docs/design/style-guide.md`.  
- Verified screen-reader order: Header → Content → Footer → Close button.
