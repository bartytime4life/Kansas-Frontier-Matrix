# ♿ Accessibility Audit — Drawer Panel (v1.3)

**Component:** Drawer Panel (v1.3)  
**Audit Date:** September 30, 2025  
**Reviewed by:** Accessibility & Design Board (`accessibility.team`)  
**Status:** ✅ Pass — Compliant with WCAG 2.1 AA  

---

## 🎯 Context

The Drawer Panel (v1.3) serves as a **collapsible side panel** used for AI chat, filters, and navigation.  
It replaced v1.2, which failed several accessibility tests related to focus management and color contrast.  
This audit confirms the fixes implemented in version 1.3 and validates the component for production release.

## 🧩 WCAG 2.1 Evaluation Results

| WCAG Ref | Criterion | Result | Notes |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **1.4.3** | Contrast (Minimum) | ✅ Pass | Text/background ratio = 4.8 : 1 |
| **2.1.1** | Keyboard Navigation | ✅ Pass | Focus trapped within drawer; tab/shift-tab cycle functional |
| **2.4.7** | Focus Visible | ✅ Pass | Accent 2 px outline visible under all themes |
| **2.3.3** | Animation from Interactions | ✅ Pass | Slide transition ≤ 200 ms; respects `prefers-reduced-motion` |
| **4.1.2** | Name, Role, Value | ✅ Pass | ARIA role `complementary`; `aria-label` provided for close button |

---

## 🧠 Summary of Findings

- ✅ **Contrast:** All text and icons pass 4.5 : 1 contrast threshold.  
- ✅ **Focus Management:** Correctly traps focus and restores to triggering element on close.  
- ✅ **Keyboard Control:** ESC key closes drawer; arrow keys scroll content.  
- ✅ **Motion Compliance:** Transitions are short, non-disorienting, and honor user preferences.  
- ✅ **ARIA Roles:** Properly set as `complementary` with descriptive label for screen readers.

No accessibility issues found during testing. Component certified for KFM v2.0 web interface.

## 📊 Accessibility Metrics

| Metric | Measured Value | WCAG Target | Status |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Text Contrast | 4.8 : 1 | ≥ 4.5 : 1 | ✅ |
| Focus Outline Contrast | 3.4 : 1 | ≥ 3 : 1 | ✅ |
| Motion Duration | 180 ms | ≤ 200 ms | ✅ |
| Keyboard Navigation Coverage | 100 % | 100 % | ✅ |

## 🧩 Developer Notes

- Drawer container uses `role="complementary"` and `aria-modal="false"`.  
- Focus trap implemented via `focus-trap-react` library.  
- ESC event listener removes focus and restores prior context.  
- Drawer width set to **360 px**, ensuring touch accessibility with ≥ 44 px control targets.  
- Motion transitions toggled off automatically when `prefers-reduced-motion` is detected.
