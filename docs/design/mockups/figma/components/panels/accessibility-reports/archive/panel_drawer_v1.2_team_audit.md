# ♿ Archived Accessibility Audit — Drawer Panel (v1.2)

**Component:** Drawer Panel (v1.2)  
**Audit Date:** September 20, 2025  
**Reviewed by:** Accessibility Team (`accessibility.team`)  
**Status:** ❌ Fail — Superseded by v1.3 (Improved Accessibility)

---

## 🎯 Context

The Drawer Panel (v1.2) was an early iteration of the collapsible side drawer used for the  
AI assistant and navigation interface.  
This version introduced essential functionality but failed accessibility validation due to  
contrast deficiencies, missing focus management, and keyboard navigation inconsistencies.

## 🧩 WCAG 2.1 Evaluation Results

| WCAG Ref | Criterion | Result | Notes |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **1.4.3** | Contrast (Minimum) | ❌ Fail | Text/background contrast only 3.8 : 1. |
| **2.1.1** | Keyboard Navigation | ❌ Fail | Focus escaped drawer into background elements. |
| **2.4.7** | Focus Visible | ⚠️ Partial | Focus outline present but insufficient contrast. |
| **2.3.3** | Animation from Interactions | ✅ Pass | Animation ≤ 200 ms, motion safe. |
| **4.1.2** | Name, Role, Value | ⚠️ Partial | ARIA role present but `aria-label` missing for close icon. |

---

## 🧠 Summary of Findings

- ❌ **Focus Trap Failure:**  
  Drawer lost focus context when nested interactive elements were present.  

- ❌ **Contrast Issues:**  
  Text elements and dividers used light gray on white (3.8 : 1), below WCAG minimum.  

- ⚠️ **Focus Visibility:**  
  Existing focus outline failed 3 : 1 contrast test.  

- ✅ **Motion & Animation:**  
  Compliant — fade/slide transition ≤ 200 ms and respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.  

- ⚠️ **ARIA Labeling:**  
  Missing `aria-label` for close icon impacted screen reader navigation.

## 📊 Accessibility Metrics

| Metric | v1.2 Result | WCAG Target | v1.3 Result | Status |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Text Contrast | 3.8 : 1 | ≥ 4.5 : 1 | 4.8 : 1 | ✅ Fixed |
| Focus Ring Contrast | 2.4 : 1 | ≥ 3 : 1 | 3.4 : 1 | ✅ Fixed |

## 🧩 Developer Notes

- Drawer lacked consistent focus management in nested tab sequences.  
- Background overlay color adjusted from `#f5f5f5` → `#f0f0f0` in v1.3 to increase contrast.  
- Added new focus ring token (`--focus-outline-accent`) in v1.3.  
- Introduced ESC key listener for immediate drawer closure.  
- Integrated screen reader support via `role="complementary"` and `aria-modal="false"`.
