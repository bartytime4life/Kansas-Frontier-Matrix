# ♿ Archived Accessibility Audit — Modal Panel (v1.9)

**Component:** Modal Panel (v1.9)  
**Audit Date:** September 25, 2025  
**Reviewed by:** Accessibility Team (`accessibility.team`)  
**Status:** ❌ Fail — Superseded by v2.0  

---

## 🎯 Context

The Modal Panel (v1.9) served as a full-screen dialog for user interactions,  
such as confirmation messages and story popups. While functionally complete,  
this version failed multiple WCAG 2.1 AA checks, including focus visibility  
and user motion preference handling.

This audit is retained as part of the MCP Accessibility Archive to demonstrate  
the iterative improvements made in version 2.0.

## 🧩 WCAG 2.1 Evaluation Results

| WCAG Ref | Criterion | Result | Notes |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **1.4.3** | Contrast (Minimum) | ✅ Pass | Text/background 4.6 : 1 |
| **2.1.1** | Keyboard Navigation | ✅ Pass | Tab order correct; ESC closes modal |
| **2.4.7** | Focus Visible | ❌ Fail | Focus outline missing for input elements |
| **2.3.3** | Animation from Interactions | ⚠️ Partial | Fade transitions not disabled with `prefers-reduced-motion` |
| **4.1.2** | Name, Role, Value | ⚠️ Partial | Close button lacked `aria-label`; fixed in next version |

---

## 🧠 Summary of Findings

- ❌ **Focus Visibility:** Input fields lacked visible focus outline,  
  making navigation difficult for keyboard users.  

- ⚠️ **Reduced Motion:** Animation not properly disabled for users with motion sensitivity.  

- ⚠️ **ARIA Compliance:** Missing `aria-label` on close button; title label not read aloud  
  in NVDA screen reader testing.  

- ✅ **Contrast & Keyboard Access:** All visual contrast ratios met standards; tab order validated.
