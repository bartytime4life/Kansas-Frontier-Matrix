# ♿ Accessibility Audit — Modal Panel (v2.0)

**Component:** Modal Panel (v2.0)  
**Audit Date:** October 6, 2025  
**Reviewed by:** Accessibility & Design Board (`accessibility.team`)  
**Status:** ✅ Pass — Fully WCAG 2.1 AA Compliant  

---

## 🎯 Context

The Modal Panel provides an **attention-focused dialog container** for confirmations,  
settings, and contextual information in the Kansas Frontier Matrix interface.  

Version 2.0 was introduced after v1.9 failed focus-visibility and motion-preference  
checks. This audit verifies that all accessibility issues were resolved and that the  
component meets **WCAG 2.1 AA** across visual, motion, and interaction domains.

## 🧩 WCAG 2.1 Evaluation Results

| WCAG Ref | Criterion | Result | Notes |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **1.4.3** | Contrast (Minimum) | ✅ Pass | Foreground text/background ratio = 4.9 : 1 |
| **2.1.1** | Keyboard Navigation | ✅ Pass | Tab cycle confined within modal; ESC closes dialog |
| **2.4.7** | Focus Visible | ✅ Pass | Accent outline visible at ≥ 3 : 1 contrast |
| **2.3.3** | Animation from Interactions | ✅ Pass | Fade transition ≤ 150 ms; honors `prefers-reduced-motion` |
| **4.1.2** | Name, Role, Value | ✅ Pass | `role="dialog"` + `aria-modal="true"` + labeled title |

---

## 🧠 Summary of Findings

- ✅ **Contrast:** Text, icons, and UI controls meet or exceed 4.5 : 1 contrast.  
- ✅ **Focus Management:** Focus is trapped within the dialog and restores to the trigger element on close.  
- ✅ **Keyboard Support:** Full tab coverage with `ESC` close behavior implemented.  
- ✅ **Motion Compliance:** Fade animation ≤ 150 ms; no slide motion or auto-play effects.  
- ✅ **ARIA Roles:** `dialog` and `alertdialog` roles tested in screen reader simulation (NVDA + VoiceOver).  

No accessibility defects were identified. Component approved for integration in the production design system.

## 📊 Accessibility Metrics

| Metric | Measured Value | WCAG Target | Status |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Text Contrast | 4.9 : 1 | ≥ 4.5 : 1 | ✅ Pass |
| Focus Ring Contrast | 3.6 : 1 | ≥ 3 : 1 | ✅ Pass |
| Motion Duration | 150 ms | ≤ 200 ms | ✅ Pass |
| Keyboard Coverage | 100 % | 100 % | ✅ Pass |
| ARIA Role Accuracy | 100 % | 100 % | ✅ Pass |

---

## 🧩 Developer Notes

- Implemented `focus-trap-react` to contain keyboard focus within modal scope.  
- ESC and overlay-click close functions tested in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.  
- Screen reader reads dialog title first; confirmed by NVDA audit.  
- Motion effects disabled automatically when `prefers-reduced-motion` is true.  
- Visual tokens (`--radius-panel`, `--shadow-elevated`) follow definitions in `style-guide.md`.
