# ♿ Archived Accessibility Audit — Drawer Panel (v1.2)

**Component:** Drawer Panel (v1.2)  
**Audit Date:** September 20, 2025  
**Reviewed by:** Accessibility Team (`accessibility.team`)  
**Status:** ❌ Fail — Superseded by v1.3  

---

## 🎯 Context

Drawer Panel v1.2 was the first implementation of a collapsible navigation drawer in the Frontier Matrix interface.  
It introduced core functionality but failed to meet key **WCAG 2.1 AA** standards for keyboard control, focus visibility, and color contrast.  
This record is preserved as part of the MCP Accessibility Archive for regression tracking and provenance validation.

## 🧩 WCAG 2.1 Evaluation Results

| WCAG Ref | Criterion | Result | Notes |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **1.4.3** | Contrast (Minimum) | ❌ Fail | Text contrast only 3.8 : 1; below threshold. |
| **2.1.1** | Keyboard Navigation | ❌ Fail | Focus escaped drawer to background. |
| **2.4.7** | Focus Visible | ⚠️ Partial | Focus indicator faint, lacked minimum contrast. |
| **2.3.3** | Animation from Interactions | ✅ Pass | Fade transition ≤ 200 ms, motion safe. |
| **4.1.2** | Name, Role, Value | ⚠️ Partial | Missing `aria-label` for close icon. |

---

## 🧠 Summary of Findings

- **Focus Trap:** Drawer failed to contain focus; users could tab into the background interface.  
- **Contrast:** Text and divider lines too light; insufficient differentiation.  
- **Focus Ring Visibility:** Existing outline did not meet 3:1 contrast requirement.  
- **ARIA Roles:** Missing for interactive elements.  
- **Motion Safety:** Fully compliant; transitions honored `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## 📊 Accessibility Metrics

| Metric | v1.2 Result | WCAG Target | v1.3 Result | Status |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Text Contrast | 3.8 : 1 | ≥ 4.5 : 1 | 4.8 : 1 | ✅ Fixed |
| Focus Ring Contrast | 2.4 : 1 | ≥ 3 : 1 | 3.4 : 1 | ✅ Fixed |
| Keyboard Focus Trap | Escaped | Contained | ✅ Fixed |
| Motion Safety | Supported | Supported | 🟢 Stable |
| ARIA Compliance | Partial | Full | ✅ Fixed |

---

## 🧩 Developer Notes

- Focus-trap logic missing in nested components; fixed in v1.3 using `focus-trap-react`.  
- Added ESC key listener for drawer close events.  
- Improved contrast by adjusting neutral palette and background overlays.  
- Introduced new design token `--focus-outline-accent` for visible focus rings.  
- Updated ARIA labels and roles for screen-reader parity.
