# ♿ Archived Accessibility Audit — Timeline Bar (v1.9)

**Component:** Timeline Bar (v1.9)  
**Audit Date:** September 30, 2025  
**Reviewed by:** Accessibility Team (`accessibility.team`)  
**Status:** ❌ Fail — Superseded by Timeline Bar v2.0  

---

## 🎯 Context

Timeline Bar v1.9 was a major step toward a unified time navigation experience in the Kansas Frontier Matrix.  
However, accessibility testing uncovered contrast, keyboard, and focus deficiencies.  
These issues were resolved in v2.0, and this record is retained for MCP provenance.

## 🧩 WCAG 2.1 Evaluation Results

| WCAG Ref | Criterion | Result | Notes |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **1.4.3** | Contrast (Minimum) | ⚠️ Partial | Timeline labels and gridlines contrast 4.0 : 1 (below threshold). |
| **2.1.1** | Keyboard Navigation | ❌ Fail | Tab order skipped zoom and playback controls. |
| **2.4.7** | Focus Visible | ❌ Fail | Focus ring lacked color contrast; outline barely visible. |
| **2.3.3** | Animation from Interactions | ✅ Pass | Motion compliant; transitions ≤ 200 ms with `prefers-reduced-motion` support. |

---

## 🧠 Summary of Findings

- ❌ **Keyboard Navigation:** Some timeline UI elements (markers, controls) were inaccessible via `Tab`.  
- ⚠️ **Focus Visibility:** Low-contrast outlines in both themes failed WCAG 2.4.7.  
- ⚠️ **Contrast Ratios:** Text and line elements did not meet 4.5 : 1 ratio.  
- ✅ **Motion Safety:** No violations; timeline transitions are compliant.

## 📊 Accessibility Metrics

| Metric | v1.9 Result | WCAG Target | v2.0 Result | Status |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Label Contrast | 4.0 : 1 | ≥ 4.5 : 1 | 4.8 : 1 | ✅ Fixed |
| Focus Outline Contrast | 2.3 : 1 | ≥ 3 : 1 | 3.5 : 1 | ✅ Fixed |
| Tab Order Coverage | Partial | Full | Full | ✅ Fixed |
| Motion Compliance | Pass | Pass | Pass | 🟢 Stable |

---

## 🧩 Developer Notes

- Implemented tokenized focus ring color (`--focus-outline-accent`) for consistent accessibility.  
- Adjusted color variables for timeline gridlines and labels to improve contrast.  
- Enhanced keyboard tab order to sequentially include markers, zoom, and playback.  
- Verified focus trapping and escape logic in modal overlay interactions.  
- Retested motion preferences under Windows and macOS accessibility settings.
