# 🗃️ Archived Accessibility Audit Report  
**Component:** AI Assistant Drawer (v1.0)  
**Date of Audit:** September 20 2025  
**Reviewed By:** Accessibility Review Board (`accessibility.team`)  

---

## 🎯 Context

This was the first accessibility audit of the AI Assistant Drawer design prototype.  
Version 1.0 served as the foundational layout for the drawer interface but lacked  
sufficient contrast, keyboard support, and visible focus indicators.  
Findings here informed **version 1.1**, which corrected these issues.

## 🧠 Observations

- **Contrast Issues:**  
  Low-contrast placeholder text and secondary labels failed Able plugin checks.  
  Corrected in v1.1 by increasing text color to `#2c2c2c`.  

- **Focus Visibility:**  
  No focus outline was rendered for the close icon or tooltip links.  
  Focus style added in v1.1 (`outline: 2px solid var(--color-accent)`).

- **Keyboard Coverage:**  
  All major elements navigable, but tooltip required mouse hover only — fixed in v1.1.  

- **Colorblind Testing:**  
  Under Deuteranopia, the accent orange (#c77d02) and warning yellow were  
  indistinguishable; hue adjusted slightly in the next release.  

- **Reduced Motion:**  
  Animation compliant with `prefers-reduced-motion`, carried over unchanged to v1.1.
