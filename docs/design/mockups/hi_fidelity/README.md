## üìö Overview

This directory hosts **high-fidelity (hi-fi) UI prototypes** used for final design validation, accessibility testing, and  
FAIR+CARE compliance verification before frontend implementation.  

Each design asset undergoes a full governance workflow:
1. Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA / 3.0 draft) testing.  
2. FAIR+CARE ethical evaluation for inclusivity and clarity.  
3. Provenance logging with SHA-256 checksum in the governance ledger.

## üß± FAIR + CARE Integration

| Principle | Implementation | Validation |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Findable** | All design assets indexed in manifest with metadata references. | `releases/v*/manifest.zip` |
| **Accessible** | Designs tested under WCAG 2.1 AA / 3.0 standards. | `design-validate.yml` |
| **Interoperable** | Design tokens align with the KFM design system. | `docs/design/standards/` |
| **Reusable** | Component-driven Figma structures support cross-project reuse. | Figma Libraries |
| **Collective Benefit (CARE)** | Culturally inclusive visuals and language. | FAIR+CARE Board Review |

---

## üß† Accessibility Review Standards

| Test | Requirement | Tool | Status |
|:--|:--|:--|:--:|
| **Contrast Ratio** | Minimum 4.5:1 for all text/UI elements. | Figma Contrast Checker | ‚úÖ |
| **Keyboard Navigation** | Logical focus order with visual indicators. | axe-core + manual audit | ‚úÖ |
| **Alt Text & Labels** | All imagery labeled and ARIA described. | Accessibility plugin | ‚úÖ |
| **Localization Support** | Text layers tagged for i18n (EN, ES, OSA). | Figma i18n plugin | ‚úÖ |
| **Animation Sensitivity** | Motion reviewed for vestibular comfort. | UX governance review | ‚úÖ |

## üîç Governance Integration

| Workflow | Function | Output |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `design-validate.yml` | Runs accessibility and FAIR+CARE validation for Figma assets. | `reports/validation/design_validation.json` |
| `policy-check.yml` | Ensures license, authorship, and metadata compliance. | `reports/audit/policy_check.json` |
| `governance-ledger.yml` | Registers SHA-256 and FAIR+CARE review in ledger. | `data/reports/audit/ui_governance_ledger.json` |

## üßæ Example Governance Record

```json
{
  "prototype_id": "focus_mode_panel_v3",
  "designer": "@kfm-ux",
  "version": "v2.1.1",
  "checksum": "sha256:54cfb7d31c1a2ee0a6d4f9eb52c8...",
  "a11y_score": 98,
  "faircare_compliance": true,
  "review_date": "2025-11-15T18:30:00Z",
  "status": "approved"
}
```

---

## üß© Integration with Frontend Development

All approved hi-fi prototypes map directly to **React components** in the web application:
- `FocusModePanel` ‚Üí `/web/src/components/focus/FocusModePanel.tsx`  
- `TimelineController` ‚Üí `/web/src/components/timeline/TimelineController.tsx`  
- `DashboardHeader` ‚Üí `/web/src/components/layout/Header.tsx`  

Design-to-code traceability is tracked through commit hashes and ledger records.
