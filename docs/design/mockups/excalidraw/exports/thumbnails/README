# 🖼️ Kansas Frontier Matrix — Excalidraw Thumbnails  
`docs/design/mockups/excalidraw/exports/thumbnails/`

**Preview · Lightweight · Visual Indexing**

</div>

## 🧭 Overview

This directory contains **thumbnail images** generated from Excalidraw sketches.  
These thumbnails serve as **lightweight previews** for browsing and indexing visual artifacts in the  
Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM) documentation system.

Each thumbnail represents a downscaled version of a full sketch export (from `/exports/`) and  
is designed to provide quick visual context for architecture, UI, and workflow designs without  
requiring users to open or render the full-size image.

## 📁 Directory Structure

```text
docs/design/mockups/excalidraw/exports/thumbnails/
├── README.md                           # This spec (GitHub-safe)
├── *.png                               # Small raster previews (≤400px width)
└── *.webp                              # Optional compressed thumbnails (preferred for web)

Naming Convention:
YYYYMMDD_topic-shortdesc-thumb.webp
Example → 20251007_navigation-flow-thumb.webp

⸻

🎯 Purpose
	•	Provide quick visual previews in documentation and GitHub listings.
	•	Allow fast page loads in Markdown indexes or data catalogs.
	•	Support automated gallery views (e.g., MkDocs or GitHub Pages grid layouts).
	•	Maintain visual consistency across design assets and directories.

🧱 Thumbnail Creation Workflow
	1.	Locate the Source File
Find the full export in:
docs/design/mockups/excalidraw/sketches/exports/
	2.	Generate the Thumbnail
Resize the image to ≤400px width (maintain aspect ratio).
Recommended toolchain:

# Using ImageMagick
magick 20251007_navigation-flow.svg -resize 400x400 thumbnails/20251007_navigation-flow-thumb.webp


	3.	Optimize File Size
Compress using lossless WebP or PNG optimization:

cwebp -q 80 input.png -o output.webp


	4.	Name and Place
Follow naming conventions and store inside this directory.
	5.	Link in Metadata
Reference the thumbnail path in the metadata file for the parent sketch (example below).

🖥️ Embedding Thumbnails

To embed thumbnails in docs (e.g., galleries, indexes, or experiment logs):

<a href="../exports/20251007_navigation-flow.svg">
  <img src="../exports/thumbnails/20251007_navigation-flow-thumb.webp" width="300" alt="Navigation Flow Sketch">
</a>

💡 Tip:
Wrap thumbnails in anchor tags linking to full-size exports for a simple “click-to-enlarge” behavior
in GitHub and MkDocs pages.

🧮 Optimization Guidelines

Asset Type	Format	Target Size	Notes
Thumbnails	.webp	≤200 KB	Best balance of quality and speed
PNG Fallback	.png	≤300 KB	Use only if transparency is required
Width	≤400 px	Maintain original aspect ratio	

Keep all thumbnails visually aligned: consistent padding, aspect ratio, and neutral background.

⸻

🔐 Provenance & Version Control
	•	All thumbnails are derived from official exports in /sketches/exports/.
	•	Never generate thumbnails directly from .excalidraw source files.
	•	Track updates via Git commits with descriptive messages referencing the parent sketch.
	•	Do not overwrite thumbnails — instead, version them (-v2, -v3) when design changes occur.
