## 🧭 Meeting Overview

The **January 10, 2025** governance meeting represented the first operational cycle under MCP-DL v6.3 standards.  
This session unified infrastructure decisions for CI/CD, data pipelines, and AI-enhanced documentation.

**Participants**

- Andy Barta — Project Lead  
- @kfm-docs — Documentation Maintainer  
- @kfm-data — Data Engineering Lead  
- @kfm-architecture — System Design  
- @kfm-governance — Compliance & Audit  
- @kfm-ai — AI Research Integration  

---

## 🧱 Agenda

1. Review 2024 archival completion and validation metrics.  
2. Confirm transition from **design to operational** stage.  
3. Discuss integration of **AI indexing** into MCP Knowledge Graph.  
4. Approve **CI/CD enhancements** for documentation auto-generation.  
5. Plan FAIR certification and Zenodo synchronization.

## 🧠 Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Responsible | Due |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Activate FAIR metadata validation pipeline | Ensure dataset interoperability and reuse | @kfm-data | 2025-02-15 |
| Enable AI summarization for meeting notes | Improve document discoverability | @kfm-ai | 2025-02-28 |
| Publish MCP-DL v6.3 documentation bundle | Align docs with current architecture state | @kfm-docs | 2025-03-01 |
| Begin deployment of Archive Browser UI | Visualize lineage between notes and archives | @kfm-architecture | 2025-03-20 |

---

## 🧮 Discussion Summary

- **CI/CD Enhancement:** Unified YAML validation, link-checking, and graph ingestion in `make docs-validate`.  
- **AI Readiness:** Standardized `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` embeddings for notes/research.  
- **FAIR Compliance:** Enforcement of **ISO 8601**, **DCAT 2.0**, and **PROV-O** across all metadata.  
- **Governance Tracking:** Quarterly reporting to `data/work/logs/docs/archive_summary_<YYYY_QN>.json`.  
- **Next Milestone:** Pilot MCP-DL v6.4 features for hybrid RDF + vector search.

## 🧩 Actions & Follow-Ups

| Action | Owner | Status | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Integrate FAIR metadata validator | @kfm-data | ✅ Complete | Scripts added to CI workflow |
| Automate note scaffolding CLI (`new_note.py`) | @kfm-docs | ✅ Complete | Released under tools/ |
| Deploy archive manifest generator | @kfm-governance | ✅ Complete | `manifest_2024.yml` verified |
| Prototype vector search in Neo4j | @kfm-ai | 🔄 In Progress | Pre-release for v6.4 |
| Publish quarterly audit report | @kfm-governance | 🗓️ Planned | Due Q1 2025 |

---

## 🧱 Technical Outcomes

- Unified **multi-schema validation** for YAML, STAC, JSON Schema, and RDF metadata.  
- Added **FAIR compliance** sections to documentation templates.  
- Integrated **Zenodo export** workflows for public archive snapshots.  
- Initiated design of the **KFM Archive Browser UI** (MapLibre + D3 + Neo4j).  
- Began implementing **auto-summarization** of meeting transcripts for the Knowledge Graph.
