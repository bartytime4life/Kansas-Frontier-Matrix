# 🧩 Kansas Frontier Matrix — **Initial Design Discussion (2024 Archive Entry)**  
`docs/notes/archive/2024/2024-02-10_initial_design_discussion.md`

**Purpose:** Preserve the **original 2024 system design discussion** that shaped the foundation of the  
**Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM)** — documenting early architecture concepts, team deliberations,  
and key decisions that established the MCP-DL documentation-first and reproducibility framework.

  This meeting captured the first full-team design discussion outlining the
  Kansas Frontier Matrix architecture: documentation-first workflows, data provenance
  principles, and cross-domain integration standards (geospatial, historical, and scientific).

## 🧭 Context

On **February 10, 2024**, the founding team of the **Kansas Frontier Matrix** held an initial  
design workshop to unify multiple data and documentation efforts into a single **MCP-aligned architecture**.  
This session laid the groundwork for:

* 🧱 **Documentation-First Principles** — codified later in MCP-DL v6.  
* 🔗 **Provenance Tracking Framework** — via PROV-O + CIDOC CRM integration.  
* 🌍 **Cross-Domain Unification** — merging GIS, historical, and scientific datasets.  
* ⚙️ **CI/CD-Integrated Governance** — early design of validation pipelines.  

---

## 🧱 Original Discussion Summary

### 🧩 Core Goals (2024 Session)
1. Consolidate fragmented research and data projects into a **single monorepo**.  
2. Enforce **metadata-first documentation** for all datasets and models.  
3. Define the baseline **Knowledge Graph schema** using Neo4j + RDF hybrid.  
4. Establish open interoperability with **STAC 1.0, DCAT 2.0, JSON Schema**, and **OWL-Time**.  
5. Prototype **cross-linking scripts** between `data/`, `docs/`, and `architecture/`.

---

### 🧠 Topics Discussed
| Theme | Key Decisions | Responsible Team |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Architecture** | Adopt modular monorepo (`src/`, `data/`, `docs/`, `tools/`). | @kfm-architecture |
| **Provenance** | Implement PROV-O lineage; enforce YAML metadata in docs. | @kfm-data |
| **Governance** | CI/CD workflows for validation and compliance. | @kfm-governance |
| **Design Language** | Use Markdown (GFM) + YAML + Mermaid as core doc stack. | @kfm-docs |
| **AI Readiness** | Future integration of semantic indexing and summarization. | @kfm-research |

## 🧮 Key Outcomes

* ✅ Defined **core MCP principle set**: Documentation-first, Provenance, Reproducibility, Transparency.  
* ✅ Agreed on **monorepo structure** with versioned submodules.  
* ✅ Created first **data-architecture.md** and **documentation.md** drafts.  
* ✅ Adopted **CC-BY 4.0 licensing** for open reproducibility.  
* ✅ Established validation workflows (`.github/workflows/site.yml` and `docs-validate.yml`).

## 📈 Historical Significance

> This meeting established KFM’s foundational principle:
> **“If it’s not documented, it didn’t happen.”**

It also marked the **transition from ad-hoc data work to MCP governance**.  
All subsequent documents, pipelines, and models trace lineage back to this event.
