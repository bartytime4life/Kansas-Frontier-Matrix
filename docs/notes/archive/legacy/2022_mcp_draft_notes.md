# ‚öôÔ∏è Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **2022 MCP Draft Notes (Legacy Archive Entry)**  
`docs/notes/archive/legacy/2022_mcp_draft_notes.md`

**Purpose:** Preserve the **2022 Master Coder Protocol (MCP) Draft Notes**, the first formal documentation outlining the design philosophy, reproducibility principles, and documentation governance that later evolved into the **Master Coder Protocol ‚Äì Documentation Language (MCP-DL)** adopted by the **Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM)**.  
This archive represents the **intellectual and operational birth of KFM‚Äôs reproducibility doctrine**.

  The 2022 MCP Draft Notes are the first formal blueprint for documentation-first
  software and data governance. This document unified previous prototypes (2018‚Äì2021)
  into a single reproducibility framework ‚Äî later codified as MCP-DL v6.3 within
  the Kansas Frontier Matrix.

## üß≠ Context

In **December 2022**, the **Frontier Data Governance Group** consolidated years of experimental documentation and reproducibility work into what became known as the **Master Coder Protocol (MCP)**.

This draft formalized:
- Governance roles and accountability structure.  
- Documentation-first, version-controlled workflows.  
- Provenance and reproducibility as auditable infrastructure.  
- The conceptual basis for **MCP-DL v6.x** and its integration into the **Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM)** ecosystem.

---

## üß© Original Objectives

1. Define the **MCP governance hierarchy** for multidisciplinary data integration.  
2. Create documentation templates with mandatory YAML metadata.  
3. Formalize the **five pillars** of reproducibility.  
4. Integrate provenance (PROV-O), ontology (CIDOC CRM), and schema validation (JSON Schema).  
5. Establish **CI/CD enforcement policies** for documentation compliance.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Five Pillars of MCP (as Drafted in 2022)

| Pillar | Description | Legacy Impact |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Documentation-First** | Every process and dataset begins as a document. | Foundation of MCP-DL. |
| **Reproducibility** | All outputs traceable to inputs via checksum and metadata. | Ensured auditability. |
| **Provenance** | Every artifact linked through PROV-O entities and agents. | Core of Knowledge Graph. |
| **Governance** | Decision-making logged, versioned, and reviewable. | CI/CD + Documentation workflows. |
| **Transparency** | Open licenses, FAIR principles, and immutable archives. | Enshrined in KFM policy. |

---

## üßæ MCP Draft Excerpt (2022)

> ‚ÄúEvery file, process, and result must exist within a provable chain of documentation.  
>  A single missing commit breaks not only the data ‚Äî it breaks the proof.‚Äù

> ‚ÄúSoftware without provenance is fiction. Documentation without versioning is entropy.‚Äù

---

## üß† Governance Hierarchy (as Proposed)

| Role | Responsibility | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **MCP Maintainer** | Oversees repository governance | Ensures compliance with documentation and reproducibility standards |
| **Data Steward** | Manages ingestion, checksum, and metadata quality | Custodian of FAIR compliance |
| **Reviewer / Auditor** | Validates documentation and graph integrity | Independent verification |
| **Contributor** | Writes new documentation or code | Must adhere to YAML + CI standards |

---

## üßÆ Technical Highlights

- Introduced **`docs/standards/documentation.md`** as governance anchor.  
- Proposed first **Mermaid-based architecture visualization** for data flow.  
- Designed early **`make docs-validate`** workflow (still active).  
- Authored prototype **templates for research, meeting, and backlog notes**.  
- Implemented **RDF exports** for provenance tracking (later automated in 2024).

## üß† Legacy Significance

The **2022 MCP Draft Notes** transformed reproducibility from an idea into an enforceable framework.  
It unified the efforts of previous years ‚Äî from ETL automation to FAIR compliance ‚Äî into a living, evolving methodology that still defines the Kansas Frontier Matrix today.
