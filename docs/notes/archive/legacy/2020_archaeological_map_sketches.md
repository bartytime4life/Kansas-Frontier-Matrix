# üè∫ Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **2020 Archaeological Map Sketches (Legacy Archive Entry)**  
`docs/notes/archive/legacy/2020_archaeological_map_sketches.md`

**Purpose:** Preserve the **2020 Archaeological Mapping Sketches** ‚Äî one of the earliest multi-domain integrations of cultural, spatial, and environmental data under the precursor to the **Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM)**.  
These sketches represent the first fusion of archaeological field records, elevation data, and historical mapping into a unified geospatial framework, anticipating the future **MCP-DL ontology model** and FAIR data architecture.

## üß≠ Context

In **late 2020**, the **Frontier Archaeology Group** and **Data Integration Team** collaborated to digitize and contextualize field records from archaeological surveys conducted across central and eastern Kansas.  
These field sketches formed the conceptual basis for the KFM cultural-heritage ontology ‚Äî linking excavation coordinates, material culture records, and environmental reconstructions.

**Key Historical Context:**
- Predates the MCP formalization (MCP-DL introduced in 2023).  
- Early experiment in **semantic integration** of archaeology + geography.  
- Prototype for **geo-ontology alignment** using CIDOC CRM and GeoSPARQL.  

---

## üß± Objectives

1. Digitize 19th‚Äì20th century archaeological site maps into GIS-readable layers.  
2. Standardize excavation record metadata using YAML templates.  
3. Prototype semantic tagging of cultural material classes using SKOS concepts.  
4. Test linking of **spatial (GeoJSON)** and **ontological (RDF)** layers.  
5. Lay groundwork for the MCP-DL **archaeology domain module** (v1.0 published 2024).

## üß© Technical Innovations

- Implemented **CIDOC CRM + GeoSPARQL** hybrid for semantic spatial linking.  
- Introduced **‚Äúgeo:hasGeometry‚Äù** property for spatial entities.  
- Developed **YAML field metadata template** (`site_id`, `period`, `location`, `materials`).  
- Generated first **RDF prototypes** for site provenance queries.  
- Proof-of-concept for **graph visualization** using Neo4j + MapLibre.

## üß† Historical Significance

> ‚ÄúThe 2020 sketches connected people, places, and processes ‚Äî the essence of provenance.‚Äù

This archive captures the **first semantic mapping** between field data and ontology-driven metadata in KFM‚Äôs history.  
It demonstrated that archaeological data could coexist with hydrology, climate, and historical treaties ‚Äî  
a conceptual leap that evolved into **semantic interoperability** within the MCP framework.
