# 🧩 Kansas Frontier Matrix — **2023 Architecture Briefing v0 (Legacy Archive Entry)**  
`docs/notes/archive/legacy/2023_architecture_briefing_v0.md`

**Purpose:** Preserve the **2023 Architecture Briefing (Version 0)** — the final **pre-MCP-DL design specification** for the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
This document represents the **architectural synthesis** of all prior prototypes (2018–2022) into a single cohesive blueprint — uniting geospatial pipelines, ontology models, FAIR data governance, and reproducible documentation practices that culminated in **MCP-DL v6.3**.

  The 2023 Architecture Briefing unified all prior KFM prototypes into a single, coherent
  system design — defining the structure of the monorepo, establishing cross-domain
  data flows, and codifying documentation-first governance under what became MCP-DL v6.3.
---
```

---

## 🧭 Context

In **mid-2023**, the **Frontier Systems Architecture Group** compiled years of prototype work — from early ETL pipelines (2018) to the MCP Draft Notes (2022) — into a single unified architecture proposal.  
This briefing served as the **transition point** between the *Pre-MCP experimental phase* and the *MCP-DL governance era*.

The document’s goal was to **synchronize architecture, ontology, and governance** — the triad that defines all MCP-DL-aligned projects today.

---

## 🧱 Objectives

1. Establish the **monorepo structure** for all data, documentation, and workflows.  
2. Define the **Knowledge Graph architecture** linking all entities (datasets, docs, and decisions).  
3. Implement a **validation-first CI/CD strategy** using YAML schemas and automated linting.  
4. Integrate **FAIR data and ontology standards** into the architecture baseline.  
5. Align project documentation, standards, and automation under MCP-DL governance.

## 🧩 Governance Innovations

- Introduced **MCP-DL YAML metadata block** as mandatory for every Markdown file.  
- Required **checksum and provenance linking** between notes, data, and workflows.  
- Proposed **auto-linting and graph ingestion validation** during every CI/CD run.  
- Recommended **Zenodo + BagIt exports** for long-term archival.  
- Formalized **quarterly governance reports** as reproducible JSON logs.

## 🧠 Historical Significance

This 2023 briefing marked the **end of the experimental era** and the **beginning of formal reproducible governance** in the Kansas Frontier Matrix.  
It was the **prototype MCP-DL specification**, detailing:
- The full integration of **data + ontology + documentation**.  
- Adoption of **FAIR metadata validation** via CI.  
- Institutionalization of **YAML front matter** as governance metadata.  
- The first explicit design of the **Knowledge Graph ingestion model**.
