# 📝 Kansas Frontier Matrix — Notes (`/docs/notes/`)

**Mission:** Provide a **lightweight, living workspace** for working notes,  
research findings, meeting logs, and brainstorming that feed into  
formal MCP documentation.

## 🎯 Purpose

The `/docs/notes/` directory is a **sandbox for thinking in public**:  
- Working drafts of ideas before they become formal docs.  
- Observations, dataset leads, or hypotheses for future testing.  
- Meeting notes, contributor discussions, or design sketches.  
- Annotated references from research, oral histories, or archives.  

Notes follow the **Master Coder Protocol (MCP)** spirit:  
- Write first, refine later — capture insights quickly.  
- Version everything in Git (no “lost context”).  
- Promote to formal docs once stabilized (move → `/docs/architecture/`, `/docs/design/`, or `/docs/integration/`).

🗂️ Suggested Workflow
	1.	Capture ideas quickly here — use research.md or ideas.md.
	2.	Cross-link notes to datasets, docs, or commits (GitHub permalinks preferred).
	3.	Review notes during sprints or milestones.
	4.	Promote stable insights to /docs/architecture, /docs/design, or /docs/integration.
	5.	Archive stale notes into /archive/ instead of deleting.
