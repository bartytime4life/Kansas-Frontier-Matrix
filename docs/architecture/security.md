# üîê **Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî Security & Compliance Architecture (v2.1.1 ¬∑ Tier-Œ©+‚àû Certified)**  
`docs/architecture/security.md`

**Mission:** Define the **security, compliance, and governance-by-design framework** that protects and verifies all systems,  
datasets, and pipelines in the **Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM)** ‚Äî aligning with FAIR+CARE, SLSA, and ISO 27001 principles.

## üìö Overview

The **Security & Compliance Architecture** ensures that KFM‚Äôs systems, pipelines, and datasets maintain integrity, confidentiality, and ethical compliance.  
Security and governance are **fully embedded into CI/CD**, with immutable provenance for every code, data, and documentation artifact.

This architecture implements **DevSecOps principles** through automation, continuous validation, and governance-led auditing.

## üß± Security Architecture Domains

| Domain | Objective | Tooling / Frameworks | Outputs |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **Application Security** | Static and dynamic code scanning for vulnerabilities. | GitHub CodeQL, Bandit | SARIF reports |
| **Data Security** | Governance, ethics, and privacy for datasets. | FAIR+CARE audits, OPA | FAIR+CARE reports |
| **Infrastructure Security** | Secure builds, container hardening, dependency checks. | Trivy, Grype, Docker Security Bench | CVE reports |
| **Supply Chain Security** | Provenance attestation for all artifacts. | SLSA, SPDX SBOM | Signed manifest |
| **Compliance & Audit** | Traceable governance of data and system integrity. | OPA / Conftest / Audit Trails | Ledger entries |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Compliance Layers

| Layer | Standard | Implementation |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Build Integrity** | SLSA Level 3 | Verified build provenance and GPG signing |
| **Dependency Security** | OWASP Top 10 / CVE Scans | Trivy + CodeQL |
| **Data Ethics** | FAIR+CARE | `faircare-validate.yml` |
| **Governance & Provenance** | ISO 27001 Annex A | Governance ledger + risk register |
| **Open Standards** | SPDX / CycloneDX | `releases/v*/sbom.spdx.json` |

---

## üßÆ Security Pipeline Lifecycle

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A["Source Commit / Pull Request"] --> B["CodeQL Scan"]
  B --> C["Trivy Image Scan"]
  C --> D["SBOM Generation (Syft)"]
  D --> E["SLSA Provenance Signing"]
  E --> F["Governance Ledger Entry"]
  F --> G["FAIR+CARE Ethics Validation"]
  G --> H["Audit Review and Release Certification"]
```
<!-- END OF MERMAID -->

Each security event (commit, merge, release) is recorded with:
- SHA-256 checksum  
- GPG signature  
- Governance council sign-off
