# ⚖️ **KFM v11 — Cardinality Governance & Enforcement**  
`docs/telemetry/metrics/cardinality/governance/README.md`

**Purpose**  
Define the **formal governance, enforcement workflows, and escalation procedures** required to maintain stable, FAIR+CARE-aligned metric cardinality across the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM) v11.2.6.  
This document governs **Active Series Budgets**, **spike detection**, **quarantine**, and **telemetry approval workflows**.

</div>

## 🗂️ Directory Layout

~~~text
docs/telemetry/metrics/cardinality/governance/
├── 📄 README.md       # Governance & enforcement rules (this file)
└── 📄 governance.md   # Detailed enforcement actions, escalation chains, templates
~~~

**Layout rules**  
- 📂 = directory, 📄 = file  
- No emojis inside ASCII connectors  
- Each directory MUST include a README describing its governance scope  

---

## 📘 Overview

This governance document provides:

- Enforcement logic for **label safety**  
- Operational handling of cardinality violations  
- Procedures for **Active Series Budget (ASB)** enforcement  
- Quarantine workflows  
- Spike-detection handling  
- Required audit logging & review cycles  
- FAIR+CARE protections for identifier misuse  
- Required escalation and remediation  

This file is the regulatory backbone for the cardinality subsystem.

---

## 🧪 Enforcement Procedures

### 1. Introducing New Metrics

Any new metric MUST:

1. Provide metadata in the telemetry catalog.  
2. Pass CI validation (metadata, label contracts, whitelist compliance).  
3. Be approved by the Telemetry Governance Council during review cycle.  
4. Declare:
   - allowed label keys  
   - bounded vocabularies  
   - expected series count  
   - stability classification  

Unreviewed metrics MUST NOT be emitted in any environment above `dev`.

---

### 2. Changing Label Schema

Changes to label keys require:

1. A governance proposal update to this directory.  
2. Review & approval.  
3. Updated metadata in catalog.  
4. CI schema refresh.  
5. Deployment after governance approval.

**Adding new labels without governance approval is a violation.**

---

### 3. Active Series Budget (ASB)

Each environment defines strict ASB values:

| Environment | Soft Threshold | Hard Limit |
|------------:|---------------:|-----------:|
| dev         | 30k            | 50k        |
| staging     | 50k            | 75k        |
| prod        | 100k           | 150k       |

**Soft threshold exceeded →** warning + governance ticket + Story Node seed.  
**Hard limit exceeded →** reject new series + quarantine offending metric.

ASB values MUST be reviewed quarterly.

---

### 4. Spike Detection

A spike is declared when:

- A new label key appears  
- Series count increases ≥30% in 5 minutes  
- A metric family grows by >10k series  
- A deploy correlates with series explosion  

On spike:

- Log anomaly → `review-log/`  
- Add to governance queue  
- Evaluate need for deny-match  
- Attach PROV-O lineage  

---

## 📉 Violations & Quarantine

### 1. Violations

Violations include:

- Using forbidden labels  
- Emitting per-entity label values  
- Breaching ASB  
- Unexpected new label keys  
- Free-text or unbounded vocabularies  
- Emitting metrics without metadata  

### 2. Enforcement Path

1. **Detect** violation (CI or runtime).  
2. **Record** anomaly in `review-log/`.  
3. **Quarantine** metric:
   - drop samples  
   - deny-match rule  
4. **Open** governance ticket.  
5. **Assign** root-cause investigation.  
6. **Generate** Story Node seed.  
7. **Review** with Telemetry Governance Council.  
8. **Remediate** and restore metrics safely.  

---

## 🔎 Audits & Review Logs

Quarterly audit MUST include:

- All ASB threshold crossings  
- All spikes  
- All new label introductions  
- All quarantined metrics  
- All governance tickets  
- All Story Node seeds  
- Compliance percentage per service  
- Proposed contract updates  

Audit results MUST be written into:

`docs/telemetry/metrics/cardinality/review-log/review-log.md`

---

## 🧠 Story Node & Focus Mode Integration

Each enforcement event is narrative-worthy.

### When violations occur:

- A Story Node seed MUST be produced summarizing:
  - violation type  
  - affected metric  
  - impact  
  - environment  
  - remediation  

- PROV-O lineage MUST be attached.

### Focus Mode MAY display:

- “Cardinality Spike Timeline”  
- “Label Introduction Map”  
- “ASB Health Over Time”  
- “Quarantine & Remediation Stories”  

Governance is therefore **story-generative** by design.

---

## ⚖ FAIR+CARE & Ethics

Metric cardinality governance protects:

- **FAIR** — stable, findable, reusable metrics  
- **CARE** — no personal identifiers in telemetry  
- **Operational safety** — preventing cost explosions  
- **Data minimization** — preventing location or ID leakage  

Telemetry that leaks sensitive identifiers violates both **CARE** and **sovereignty** policies and MUST be quarantined immediately.
