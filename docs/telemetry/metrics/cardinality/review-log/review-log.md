# 📈 **Cardinality Review Log (Quarterly Ledger) v11.2.2**  
`docs/telemetry/metrics/cardinality/review-log/review-log.md`

**Purpose**  
Serve as the **authoritative quarterly ledger** for metric cardinality anomalies in KFM v11.  
This log records **ASB usage**, **spikes**, **forbidden labels**, **quarantined metrics**, **governance tickets**, and **Story Node seeds**.

</div>

---

## 📘 Overview

This file is the **active ledger** for all cardinality governance events.  
Entries MUST follow:

- **Newest first**  
- **Stable formatting** (machine-parseable)  
- **FAIR+CARE compliance**  
- **PROV-O lineage**  
- **Governance auditability**

Each entry is treated as a `prov:Activity` referencing:

- `prov:Entity` (metric)  
- `prov:Agent` (service/team)  
- `prov:Plan` (governance rule)  

---

## 🧠 Story Node & Focus Mode Integration

Review-log entries are consumed by Focus Mode to build:

- Spike timelines  
- Remediation narratives  
- Deployment → cardinality impact mappings  
- “System Health Over Time” visual stories  
- Per-metric health summaries  

Each entry MUST seed a Story Node with:

- A short synopsis  
- Offending labels  
- Impact  
- Governance ticket reference  
- Remediation steps  

---

## ⚖ FAIR+CARE & Governance

This ledger enforces:

- **FAIR**:  
  - Complete provenance  
  - Machine-readable structured entries  
  - Open format for downstream analysis  

- **CARE**:  
  - No user-level identifiers  
  - No sensitive coordinates  
  - Minimal, ethical telemetry exposure  

All entries must pass CARE screening before merge.
