## 1. Purpose

**CONFIRMED doctrine.** Release is one of the five governed transitions in KFM's lifecycle invariant — `RAW → WORK/QUARANTINE → PROCESSED → CATALOG/TRIPLET → PUBLISHED`. It is *not* a file move; it is a recorded state change with required artifacts, a recorded policy decision, and a rollback target.

This register exists so that every reader — steward, reviewer, release authority, downstream consumer, or auditor — can answer four questions from one page:

1. **What release states does KFM recognize?**
2. **What artifacts must exist for a release to enter, leave, or revert a state?**
3. **Who is allowed to make the decision, and when must the author *not* be the approver?**
4. **What does a public client see, and under what conditions may a `ReleaseManifest` be consumed publicly?**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Release is a **trust-membrane gate.** Public clients, normal UI surfaces, and any released AI surface reach content *only* via `PUBLISHED` releases. They never reach `RAW`, `WORK`, `QUARANTINE`, canonical/internal stores, graph internals, vector indexes, source APIs, or direct model runtimes.

## 2. Repo fit

This document is the **human-facing** half of the release state register. Its machine-readable counterpart is `control_plane/release_state_register.yaml`. Per Directory Rules: `docs/` explains, `control_plane/` indexes, `contracts/` defines meaning, `schemas/` defines shape. These four are different layers of the same governance function and **MUST NOT** collapse into one another.

**Proposed location:** `docs/registers/RELEASE_STATE.md` (PROPOSED — not explicitly named in Directory Rules §6.1's canonical examples, but is the natural sibling of `AUTHORITY_LADDER.md`, `CANONICAL_LINEAGE_EXPLORATORY.md`, `DRIFT_REGISTER.md`, `VERIFICATION_BACKLOG.md`).

```text
docs/
└── registers/
    ├── AUTHORITY_LADDER.md
    ├── CANONICAL_LINEAGE_EXPLORATORY.md
    ├── DRIFT_REGISTER.md
    ├── VERIFICATION_BACKLOG.md
    ├── OBJECT_FAMILY_MAP.md
    └── RELEASE_STATE.md          ← this document (PROPOSED)
```

**Upstream (what this register depends on):**

- `docs/doctrine/lifecycle-law.md` — the `RAW → … → PUBLISHED` invariant.
- `docs/doctrine/trust-membrane.md` — the boundary that keeps internal state out of public surfaces.
- `docs/doctrine/authority-ladder.md` — who decides what at each gate.
- `schemas/contracts/v1/release/ReleaseManifest.schema.json` — the `release_state` enum and binding fields. *(PROPOSED path; verify against repo.)*

**Downstream (what this register binds together):**

- `release/manifests/` — `ReleaseManifest` artifacts.
- `release/rollback_cards/` — `RollbackCard` decisions.
- `release/correction_notices/` — `CorrectionNotice` records.
- `control_plane/release_state_register.yaml` — machine-readable mirror.
- Validators under `tools/validators/release/`. *(PROPOSED path.)*

## 3. What belongs here

- The **enumerated set** of release states KFM recognizes and the semantics of each.
- The **transitions** between states, with required pre-conditions and artifacts.
- The **failure-closed posture** for each transition (what holds when a precondition is unresolved).
- The **public runtime rule** that governs when a `ReleaseManifest` may be consumed by a public client.
- The **separation-of-duties matrix** for release-class decisions.
- **Reason codes** that release-related gates may emit.
- Pointers to the artifacts, schemas, policies, validators, and tests that operationalize each state.

## 4. What does *not* belong here

- ❌ **`ReleaseManifest` field-level shape.** That lives in `schemas/contracts/v1/release/`.
- ❌ **Object-family meaning** for `ReleaseManifest`, `RollbackCard`, `CorrectionNotice`. That lives in `contracts/`.
- ❌ **Admissibility / publication policy rules** (allow / deny conditions). Those live in `policy/release/` and are evaluated by OPA / equivalent.
- ❌ **Per-domain release decisions, artifact inventories, or release notes.** Those live in `release/manifests/<release_id>/` and per-domain release dossiers.
- ❌ **Drift entries.** Those live in `docs/registers/DRIFT_REGISTER.md`.
- ❌ **Open verification questions.** Those live in `docs/registers/VERIFICATION_BACKLOG.md`.

## 5. The five release states

**CONFIRMED doctrine, derived from the `ReleaseManifest.release_state` enum:**
`DRAFT | REVIEW | PUBLISHED | REVOKED | SUPERSEDED`.

| State | What it means | Public-visible? | Counts as truth? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **DRAFT** | A release candidate is being assembled. Artifacts, evidence refs, rollback target, and policy decisions are being collected. | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **REVIEW** | The candidate has been submitted for steward, sensitivity, rights-holder, or release-authority review per separation-of-duties rules. | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **PUBLISHED** | The release has cleared all gates. It is the **only** state from which the governed API may emit `ANSWER`, and the only state public clients may consume. | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (until corrected, revoked, or superseded) |
| **REVOKED** | A previously `PUBLISHED` release has been withdrawn. A `RollbackCard` and/or `CorrectionNotice` records why; downstream derivatives are invalidated. | Stale-marked, not silently | ❌ No |
| **SUPERSEDED** | The release has been replaced by a newer `ReleaseManifest`. Both manifests are retained; the supersession lineage is queryable. | Stale-marked, lineage visible | ❌ As current truth; ✅ as historical record |

> [!NOTE]
> A `release_state` value of `DRAFT` or `REVIEW` is **never** a basis for a public claim. A consumer that sees `release_state != "PUBLISHED"` must treat the artifact as non-truth and surface that state, not silently render it.

## 6. State transition diagram

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> DRAFT: assemble candidate
    DRAFT --> DRAFT: amend artifacts / evidence
    DRAFT --> REVIEW: submit for review
    REVIEW --> DRAFT: review_rejected / artifacts_incomplete
    REVIEW --> PUBLISHED: gates pass · release authority signs
    PUBLISHED --> PUBLISHED: CorrectionNotice (same release_id)
    PUBLISHED --> SUPERSEDED: next release replaces this one
    PUBLISHED --> REVOKED: failed release / post-publication failure
    REVOKED --> PUBLISHED: rollback target re-asserted
    SUPERSEDED --> [*]: retained for lineage
    REVOKED --> [*]: retained for lineage

    note right of REVIEW
        Release authority MUST
        differ from author when
        materiality applies.
    end note

    note right of PUBLISHED
        Public clients may consume
        ReleaseManifest only here,
        and only when policy/rights/
        sensitivity/rollback/evidence
        all resolve.
    end note
```

> [!NOTE]
> The diagram is **normative** for transitions but **illustrative** for cardinality (a single `PUBLISHED` release may be amended by multiple `CorrectionNotice` events without changing `release_state`).

## 7. Required artifacts per transition

**CONFIRMED doctrine (lifecycle gates):** a transition is closed only when (i) the required artifacts below exist, (ii) every required artifact *resolves* the artifacts it depends on (`EvidenceRef → EvidenceBundle`, `source_id → SourceDescriptor`, `model_id → ModelRunReceipt`), and (iii) the policy gate evaluated and recorded its decision. Missing any of these → **fail closed**, prior state preserved.

| From → To | Pre-conditions | Required artifacts | Failure-closed outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| `— → DRAFT` | Catalog closure complete; `EvidenceRef`s resolve; `CatalogMatrix` entry exists. | `ReleaseManifest` (draft); inventoried artifacts; evidence refs; provisional rollback target. | Stay at `CATALOG`. No `ReleaseManifest` created. |
| `DRAFT → REVIEW` | All `ReleaseManifest` required fields present; artifact digests computed; policy pre-check passes. | `ValidationReport` (release-level); `PolicyDecision` (pre-publication); rollback target identified. | Stay in `DRAFT`. Structured FAIL outcome. |
| `REVIEW → PUBLISHED` | Review state adequate; release authority distinct from original author when materiality applies. | `ReviewRecord`(s); final `PolicyDecision` (ALLOW); `ReleaseManifest` signed; `RollbackCard` plan reference. | `HOLD at CATALOG`; no public surface change. |
| `PUBLISHED → PUBLISHED′` *(correction)* | Detected error or new evidence; downstream derivatives identified. | `CorrectionNotice`; `ReviewRecord`; invalidation list; `ReleaseManifest` update or supersession. | Stale-state announcement on the affected claim; **no silent edit**. |
| `PUBLISHED → SUPERSEDED` | A newer `ReleaseManifest` has been `PUBLISHED` for the same scope. | New `ReleaseManifest` with `correction_lineage` link; supersession entry. | Old manifest retained; not deleted. |
| `PUBLISHED → REVOKED` | Failed release or post-publication failure; targeted prior release identified. | `RollbackCard`; `CorrectionNotice`; `ReleaseManifest` reverts to prior release; downstream derivative invalidation. | Held at current state until rollback validated. |
| `REVOKED → PUBLISHED` *(rollback re-assertion)* | Rollback target validated; rollback drill executed. | Re-issued `ReleaseManifest` referencing rollback target; `ReviewRecord` of the rollback decision. | Stay `REVOKED` until validation passes. |

## 8. Public runtime rule (the PUBLISHED gate)

**CONFIRMED doctrine.** A public client may consume a `ReleaseManifest` **only when every following condition holds simultaneously**:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **All six must hold. Any one missing → DENY.**
> 1. `release_state == "PUBLISHED"`
> 2. `policy_label` is known and not `unknown`
> 3. `rights_status` is known and not `unknown`
> 4. `sensitivity == "public"` (not `generalized`, `restricted`, or `review_required`)
> 5. `evidence_refs` is non-empty and each ref resolves to an `EvidenceBundle`; each artifact has a content digest (`sha256` / `blake3`)
> 6. `rollback.rollback_supported == true` and `rollback` has a valid plan / previous-release reference

A release that satisfies (1) but fails any of (2)–(6) is a **release-infrastructure error**, not a public artifact. The governed API responds with `DENY` and the corresponding reason code (§9). This is the operational form of *cite-or-abstain*: missing rollback or unknown rights → fail closed, never silently degrade.

## 9. Release-related reason codes

> [!NOTE]
> **PROPOSED catalog.** These are the reason codes the release and adjacent gates may emit. Codes are stable identifiers; their messages may be localized. See `policy/release/` for the authoritative rule set (PROPOSED path) and the per-domain releases for examples.

| Reason code | Gate(s) where it fires | Recovery path |
|---|---|---|
| `MISSING_RECEIPT` | Catalog / Release | Re-emit the missing receipt; re-run gate. |
| `MISSING_EVIDENCE` | Catalog / Release | Resolve `EvidenceRef`s; re-run validator. |
| `MISSING_REVIEW` | Catalog / Release | Run required review; supply `ReviewRecord`. |
| `SCHEMA_MISMATCH` | Validation / Release | Schema fix and/or ADR; re-run validator. |
| `CONTRACT_DRIFT` | Validation / Release | Reconcile contract; re-run validator. |
| `RIGHTS_UNKNOWN` | Admission / Validation / Catalog / Release | Steward review; rights resolution. |
| `SENSITIVITY_UNRESOLVED` | Admission / Validation / Catalog / Release | Sensitivity reviewer; tier reassignment. |
| `ROLE_COLLAPSE` | Validation / Catalog / Release | Restore source role; refuse upcast. |
| `ROLE_DOWNCAST_FORBIDDEN` | Validation / Catalog / Release | Reject downcast. |
| `REVIEW_NEEDED` | Catalog / Release | Open review queue entry. |
| `REVIEW_INSUFFICIENT` | Catalog / Release | Escalate / re-review with adequate role coverage. |
| `REVIEW_REJECTED` | Catalog / Release | Return to `DRAFT`; revise. |
| `RELEASE_MANIFEST_INVALID` | Release | Manifest fix; re-validate against `ReleaseManifest` schema. |
| `ROLLBACK_TARGET_MISSING` | Release | Supply rollback target; verify with rollback drill. |
| `CORRECTION_DERIVATIVES_UNRESOLVED` | Correction | Resolve and invalidate derivatives. |
| `CORRECTION_PRIOR_RELEASE_MISSING` | Correction | Supersession entry; chain repair. |

## 10. Separation of duties

**CONFIRMED doctrine (operating-law invariant 9):** KFM separates policy-significant release duties when maturity justifies it. The table below reflects the **PROPOSED** separation matrix consolidated from the Domains Culmination Atlas.

| Action | May the author also approve? | Required separation | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Release to PUBLISHED** | ❌ No when materiality applies. | Author ≠ release authority; rights-holder rep where applicable. | The default for any non-trivial public-facing release. |
| **Sensitive-lane release** | ❌ No. | Author + sensitivity reviewer + release authority + rights-holder rep. | Applies to archaeology, sovereign data, living-person data, DNA data, rare-species locations, and infrastructure detail. |
| **Correction / rollback** | ❌ No when correction is steward-significant. | Author / detector + correction reviewer + release authority. | Corrections of policy-significant claims always separated. |
| **AI surface change** (template / policy binding) | ❌ No. | AI surface steward + docs steward (policy binding). | Focus Mode template changes are release-class. |
| **Atlas / supplement publication** | ❌ No. | Docs steward + at least one subsystem owner. | Per Directory Rules. |

> [!WARNING]
> **Maturity caveat.** Directory Rules §2 and operating law treat separation of duties as **maturity-dependent**. Early-stage doctrine work may be authored and approved by the same actor when materiality is low. As the public trust surface expands, separation **must** be enforced through tooling (CODEOWNERS, branch protection, required-review automation) and not by custom. This register documents the rule; it does not certify the enforcement.

[↑ Back to top](#release-state-register)

---

## 11. Stale, superseded, and rollback semantics

KFM separates **stale** (evidence has aged past tolerance) from **wrong** (substance is incorrect). Both have visible markers; neither permits silent edits.

| Situation | Manifest state | Required marker | Required action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Source freshness expired | `PUBLISHED` (stale-flagged) | Stale source badge in Evidence Drawer | Re-admit or supersede; otherwise mark dependents stale. |
| Schema version drift | `PUBLISHED` (stale-flagged) | Schema-drift badge; migration ADR if any | Migrate, re-validate, re-release — *or* mark stale. |
| Geography version drift | `PUBLISHED` (stale-flagged) | Geography-version banner | Rebind, re-release, or mark stale. |
| Model version superseded | `PUBLISHED` (stale-flagged) | Model-version badge | Re-run model; supersede; or mark stale. |
| Review aged out | `PUBLISHED` (stale-flagged) | Review-aged badge | Trigger steward review; potentially downgrade tier. |
| Rights changed | `PUBLISHED` → potentially `REVOKED` | Rights-changed badge | Re-evaluate tier; emit `CorrectionNotice`; revoke if necessary. |
| Policy version changed | `PUBLISHED` (stale-flagged) | Policy-version badge | Re-run gate; potentially supersede. |
| Substantive error detected | `PUBLISHED` → `PUBLISHED′` or `REVOKED` | `CorrectionNotice` | Issue correction; invalidate derivatives. |
| Failed release | `PUBLISHED` → `REVOKED` | `RollbackCard` | Revert to prior release; validate. |
| Newer release replaces this | `PUBLISHED` → `SUPERSEDED` | Supersession lineage entry | Retain both manifests; chain `correction_lineage`. |

> [!CAUTION]
> A stale-flagged `PUBLISHED` release is still `PUBLISHED`, but its public surface **must** carry the marker. Hiding staleness is a publication failure and a candidate `DRIFT_REGISTER` entry.

- **`control_plane/release_state_register.yaml`** is the machine-readable form of the same enum and transition table. If the two diverge, the **doctrine** wins; reconcile by raising a `DRIFT_REGISTER` entry, not by silently editing either side.
- **`docs/registers/DRIFT_REGISTER.md`** is where release-state conflicts (e.g., a manifest in `PUBLISHED` without a rollback target) are recorded for triage.
- **`docs/registers/VERIFICATION_BACKLOG.md`** is where unresolved release-class ADRs live (e.g., ADR-S-08, ADR-S-11 from the Culmination Atlas).

## 13. FAQ

> [!TIP]
> Questions that recur in review should be added here, not re-litigated each time.

**Q. Can a release skip `REVIEW` and go directly from `DRAFT` to `PUBLISHED`?**
A. Only when materiality is low *and* separation-of-duties does not apply. Sensitive lanes (archaeology, sovereign data, living-person data, DNA, rare-species locations, infrastructure detail) **always** require `REVIEW`. When in doubt, route through `REVIEW`.

**Q. What's the difference between `REVOKED` and `SUPERSEDED`?**
A. `REVOKED` says *"this release was wrong or failed; do not consume it."* `SUPERSEDED` says *"this release was correct for its time; a newer release replaces it for current consumers."* Both are retained for lineage; neither permits silent deletion.

**Q. If I find a bug in a `PUBLISHED` release, do I edit the manifest?**
A. **No.** Issue a `CorrectionNotice`; depending on severity, transition to `PUBLISHED′` (corrected, same `release_id`), `SUPERSEDED` (new `release_id` replaces it), or `REVOKED` (withdraw and roll back). Silent edits are the canonical anti-pattern.

**Q. Where does the AI surface fit?**
A. The governed API may emit `ANSWER` **only** from `PUBLISHED` releases that satisfy all six public-runtime conditions (§8). `DRAFT`, `REVIEW`, `REVOKED`, and `SUPERSEDED` are not reachable by released AI surfaces.

**Q. Is `release_state` the same as lifecycle phase?**
A. No. Lifecycle phase tracks the **content's** journey (`RAW → … → PUBLISHED`); `release_state` tracks the **release decision's** journey (`DRAFT → REVIEW → PUBLISHED → {REVOKED, SUPERSEDED}`). A `ReleaseManifest` only exists once content reaches `CATALOG/TRIPLET`; from that point, the release decision has its own state machine.

<details>
<summary><strong>Appendix A — <code>ReleaseManifest</code> <code>release_state</code> enum reference</strong></summary>

The `release_state` enum below is **CONFIRMED** doctrine derived from the project's `ReleaseManifest` schema sketch. Field-level shape is defined in `schemas/contracts/v1/release/ReleaseManifest.schema.json` (PROPOSED path).

```json
{
  "release_state": {
    "enum": ["DRAFT", "REVIEW", "PUBLISHED", "REVOKED", "SUPERSEDED"]
  }
}
```

**Companion `ReleaseManifest` fields that interact with `release_state`:**

| Field | Type | Public-runtime requirement |
|---|---|---|
| `release_id` | `string` | Required in every state. |
| `created` | `date-time` | Required. |
| `spec_hash` | `string` | Required; deterministic identity. |
| `policy_label` | `enum: public \| restricted \| unknown` | Must not be `unknown` when `PUBLISHED` for public consumption. |
| `rights_status` | `enum: open \| controlled \| restricted \| unknown` | Must not be `unknown` when `PUBLISHED` for public consumption. |
| `sensitivity` | `enum: public \| generalized \| restricted \| review_required` | Must be `public` for public consumption. |
| `artifacts[]` | array of `{artifact_id, kind, path, sha256, blake3?}` | Required; `kind ∈ {pmtiles, stac, geojson, parquet, model, manifest, receipt}`. |
| `evidence_refs[]` | array of references | Required; must resolve to `EvidenceBundle`. |
| `attestations[]` | array of references | Required when policy demands signed attestation (e.g., DSSE / cosign). |
| `correction_lineage[]` | array of references | Records correction / supersession ancestry. |
| `rollback.rollback_supported` | `boolean` | Must be `true` for public consumption. |
| `rollback.previous_release` | `string \| null` | Required when `rollback_supported == true`. |
| `rollback.rollback_plan_ref` | `string \| null` | Pointer to the rollback drill / plan. |

> [!NOTE]
> Treat this appendix as **explanatory**, not normative. The schema file is the normative source; if they diverge, raise a `DRIFT_REGISTER` entry.

<summary><strong>Appendix B — Change discipline for this register</strong></summary>

| Change type | What's required |
|---|---|
| Typo, clarification, dead-link fix | Routine PR. |
| Adding / removing a reason code | PR + reviewer sign-off; mirror change in `control_plane/release_state_register.yaml` and `policy/release/`. |
| Adding / removing a `release_state` enum value | **ADR required.** Mirror in `ReleaseManifest` schema with version bump; update all manifest fixtures and validators. |
| Changing the public-runtime rule (§8) | **ADR required.** Coordinate with `docs/doctrine/trust-membrane.md` owner and `policy/release/`. |
| Changing the separation-of-duties matrix (§10) | **ADR required.** Coordinate with `docs/doctrine/authority-ladder.md`. |
| Reversing a previously canonical rule | **ADR + supersession notice + drift register entry.** |

Every PR touching this file MUST update the "Last reviewed" line in the impact block and cite the ADR if it falls in an ADR-required row above. Anchor stability matters: §-numbered headings are referenced from `policy/release/` rule comments and `control_plane/release_state_register.yaml` notes; renumbering them is a breaking change.
