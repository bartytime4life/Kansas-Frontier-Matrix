# 🤖🌊 Kansas Frontier Matrix — **Arkansas River AI-Reconstructed Streamflow Lineage**

This directory contains all **AI-generated and AI-enhanced** Arkansas River  
streamflow lineage chains produced across KFM’s autonomous and hybrid  
hydrology engines:

- **Focus Mode v2.5** (gap-filling, anomaly smoothing, harmonization, fusion)  
- **Story Node v3** (temporal–narrative hydrologic scenarios)  
- **ML-Fusion pipelines** (satellite × gauge × climate × hydrologic models)  

These reconstructions repair missing data, correct inconsistencies, and  
produce physically coherent long-term hydrology aligned with observed  
Arkansas River basin behavior.

All AI-based records are:

- 🧬 **PROV-O JSON-LD documented**  
- 🔐 **Hash-verified & SBOM/SLSA notarized**  
- ⚖️ **FAIR+CARE governed**  
- 🔁 **Fully reconstructible (ASCII-only instructions)**  
- 🌍 **Energy/carbon-telemetry tracked**

# 🧠 2. Overview of AI Reconstruction Types

### 🤖 Focus Mode v2.5 — Autonomous Hydrologic Reasoning  
Used for:  
- Gap-filling  
- Temporal harmonization  
- Multi-gauge alignment  
- Bias correction  
- Uncertainty-aware smoothing  
- Reconstruction of corrupted sensor intervals  

Focus Mode outputs include detailed reasoning metadata, hyperparameters,  
and energy/carbon telemetry logs.

---

### 📜 Story Node v3 — Narrative Temporal Hydrology  
Used for:  
- Scenario-based flow reconstruction  
- Climate-conditioned narrative hydrology  
- Basin-scale “what-if” hydrologic storytelling  
- Multi-sample ensemble generation with uncertainty  

Story Node v3 generates hydrologically anchored temporal narratives  
aligned with basin history, ecology, and climate.

---

### 🔬 ML-Fusion — Hybrid Neural–Physics Hydrology  
Used for:  
- Satellite discharge proxy fusion  
- Climate-index informed reconstruction (ENSO/PDO/etc.)  
- HEC-HMS / SWAT / VIC model blending  
- GNSS-based hydrometry proxy integration  
- Multi-source variance stabilization  

ML-Fusion outputs provide stable reconstructions even when observational  
coverage is sparse or fragmented.

---

# 🧬 3. PROV-O Entity Requirements

Each dataset state (`prov:Entity`) includes:

- SHA-256 digest  
- Spatial and temporal coverage  
- CARE metadata (tribal-water sensitivity)  
- STAC/DCAT descriptors  
- Uncertainty representation  
- ASCII-only reconstruction protocol  
- SBOM & SLSA references  

---

# ⚙️ 4. PROV-O Activity Requirements

Each AI activity (`prov:Activity`) logs:

- AI model version  
- Hyperparameters  
- Fusion weights or scenario configuration  
- Execution environment  
- Carbon/energy telemetry  
- Preprocessor & postprocessor details  
- Cultural/governance filters (CARE)  

---

# 👤 5. PROV-O Agents

Agents (`prov:Agent`) include:

- Focus Mode v2.5  
- Story Node v3  
- ML-Fusion engine  
- Hydrologists, model reviewers  
- Tribal stewardship reviewers (CARE-restricted roles)  
- KFM lineage engine  
- ETL validators and governance auditors  

Each agent includes explicit role, authority domain, and responsibility.

---

# 🧪 6. Validation Requirements

Every AI lineage chain must pass:

- PROV-O JSON-LD validation  
- Hash-chain continuity  
- SBOM/SLSA attestation verification  
- Hydrologic plausibility tests  
- Temporal alignment audits  
- CARE cultural governance review  
- Full reproducibility test (binary-identical outputs)  

No lineage is accepted unless **100% validation** is achieved.

# 🔮 8. Roadmap (v11.3–v12.0)

- Multi-model ensemble lineage (FocusMode × StoryNode × ML-Fusion)  
- 4D hydrologic scenario reconstruction (time × flow × climate × uncertainty)  
- AI-detected anomaly lineage mapping (basin-wide)  
- Integration with tribal digital hydrology repositories (CARE-restricted)  
- Reinforcement-guided hydrology reconstruction (Focus Mode v3.0)
