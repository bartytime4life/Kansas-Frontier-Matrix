# 🤖💧 Kansas Frontier Matrix — **Baseline Gap-Fill Lineage (Focus Mode v2.5 · Republican River)**

This directory contains the **canonical PROV-O lineage chains** for  
**baseline gap-fill hydrologic reconstructions** performed by  
**Focus Mode v2.5** on the **Republican River streamflow archive**.

Gap-fill reconstruction restores:

- Long gaps due to missing gauge logs  
- Outages caused by sensor replacements or failures  
- Digitization losses from damaged analog media  
- Missing values from snow/ice obstructions  
- Corrupted or incomplete early digital measurements  

Focus Mode v2.5 applies **hydrology-aware**, **climate-conditioned**, and  
**neuro-symbolic** reconstruction algorithms that guarantee hydrologic  
plausibility, strict CARE compliance, and reproducibility.

`lineage.jsonld` is the definitive, hash-verified provenance record for all  
Republican River gap-fill operations.

# 🧠 2. Overview of Focus Mode v2.5 Gap-Fill Strategies

### 🧩 Temporal Reconstruction Models  
- Long-memory hydrologic embeddings  
- Seasonal cycle inference  
- Flood/drought signature reinforcement  
- Gap-aware autoregressive reconstruction  

### 🛰 Multi-Source Conditioning  
- Upstream/downstream gauge correlation  
- Satellite hydrometry (river width, surface reflectance)  
- ENSO/PDO/SPI climate indices  
- Soil-moisture and precipitation composites  

### 🌊 Physical Constraints  
- Conservation of hydrograph shape  
- Flood-pulse and recession-curve continuity  
- Event-sequence realism checks  
- Basin-scale hydrologic priors  

### 🔬 Statistical & ML Fusion  
- Bayesian smoothing  
- Drift-corrected interpolation  
- Neural autoregressive modeling  
- Variance-preserving uncertainty channels

# 🧬 3. PROV-O Entity Requirements (`prov:Entity`)

Each dataset state must include:

- SHA-256 digest  
- Temporal + spatial extent  
- CARE metadata (tribal sensitivity classification)  
- STAC/DCAT descriptors  
- Uncertainty metadata (sigma/posterior)  
- ASCII reconstruction instructions  
- SBOM reference  
- Upstream/downstream dependency links  

---

# ⚙️ 4. PROV-O Activity Requirements (`prov:Activity`)

Each lineage activity records:

### 🔧 Gap-Fill Inference  
- Focus Mode v2.5 build signature  
- Hyperparameters and context window  
- Conditioning sources (satellite, climate, gauge)  
- Boundary and continuity rules  

### 🧮 Post-Processing  
- Hydrologic smoothing  
- Drift correction  
- Event-range validation  
- Uncertainty propagation  

### 🌍 Telemetry  
- Energy consumption  
- Carbon cost  
- Execution environment  
- Deterministic seed metadata  

### 🧭 Governance  
- CARE review  
- FAIR compliance  
- SLSA provenance  
- Access restrictions

# 👤 5. PROV-O Agents (`prov:Agent`)

Agents include:

- **Focus Mode v2.5** — autonomous hydrologic reasoning engine  
- Hydrologists & dataset validators  
- Digitization teams (historic ties)  
- Tribal cultural reviewers (CARE authority)  
- KFM lineage engine  
- Governance auditors  

Each agent is recorded with authority, role, and accountability metadata.

---

# 🧪 6. Validation Requirements

Gap-fill lineages must pass:

- PROV-O schema validation  
- Full SHA-256 hash-chain continuity  
- SBOM/SLSA verification  
- Hydrologic plausibility tests (flood, drought, regime stability)  
- Temporal alignment checks  
- CARE cultural governance audit  
- Reconstructibility validation (ASCII-only)  

Only **zero-error** chains enter the archive.

# 🔎 7. Retrieval Examples (v11.2+)

```
kfm provenance chains expand --dataset hydrology/streamflow/ks_mainstem/republican-river/ai-reconstructed/focus-mode-v2.5/baseline-gapfill
kfm provenance chains reconstruct --id hydrology/.../republican-river/baseline-gapfill
kfm provenance chains agent --name "FocusMode v2.5"
```

# 🔮 8. Roadmap (v11.3–v12.0)

- Focus Mode v3.0 reinforcement-learned hydrology  
- Multi-engine ensemble lineage (FM v2.5 × ML-Fusion × Story Node v3)  
- Basin-scale temporal fusion lineage (CO → NE → KS)  
- CARE-restricted cultural hydrology extension layer  
- 4D flow × time × uncertainty × climate lineage visualization
