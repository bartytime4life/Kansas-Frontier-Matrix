# 🤖🌊 Kansas Frontier Matrix — **Republican River AI-Reconstructed Streamflow Lineage**

This directory preserves all **AI-generated** and **AI-augmented** hydrologic lineage chains  
for the **Republican River**.  
These reconstructions play a central role in filling gaps, repairing corrupted records,  
aligning multi-era measurements, and creating physically coherent flow histories  
for one of Kansas’s most legally and hydrologically important rivers.

The AI lineage layer includes outputs from:

- **Focus Mode v2.5** — hydrology-aware autonomous reasoning  
- **Story Node v3** — narrative–temporal climate-conditioned hydrologic scenarios  
- **ML-Fusion pipelines** — satellite × gauge × climate × hydrologic model composites  

Every reconstruction is:

- 🧬 PROV-O JSON-LD encoded  
- 🔐 Hash-verified  
- 🛰 SBOM/SLSA-attested  
- ⚖️ FAIR+CARE governed  
- 🔁 ASCII-reconstructible  
- 🌍 Telemetry-tracked for energy/carbon

# 🧠 2. Overview of AI Reconstruction Types

## 🤖 Focus Mode v2.5 — Autonomous Hydrologic Engine
Performs:

- Gap-filling  
- Anomaly correction  
- Multi-station harmonization  
- Satellite/gauge/climate fusion  
- Uncertainty-aware reconstruction  

Outputs include reasoning metadata, hyperparameters, and energy/carbon telemetry.

---

## 📜 Story Node v3 — Narrative Temporal Hydrology
Generates:

- Climate-conditioned scenario hydrology  
- “What-if” flow narratives  
- Ecological and cultural hydrology storytelling  
- Multi-sample ensemble narrative flows  
- Context-driven reconstructions for historical or projected timelines  

All narrative outputs are validated for hydrologic plausibility and CARE sensitivity.

---

## 🔬 ML-Fusion — Hybrid Neural–Physics Hydrology
Combines:

- Satellite discharge proxies  
- Climate indices (ENSO/PDO/SPI/PDSI)  
- Gauge records  
- Hydrologic models (HEC-HMS / SWAT / VIC)  
- Neural sequence models  

Produces stable, high-fidelity flow series even under sparse data conditions.

---

# 🧬 3. PROV-O Entity Requirements (`prov:Entity`)

All AI-generated dataset states include:

- SHA-256 digest  
- Spatial/temporal extents  
- STAC/DCAT descriptors  
- CARE metadata (tribal-water sensitivity class)  
- Uncertainty metadata (sigma/posterior form)  
- ASCII reconstruction instructions  
- SBOM reference  
- Dependency graph references  

---

# ⚙️ 4. PROV-O Activity Requirements (`prov:Activity`)

Activities for AI reconstructions capture:

### 🔧 Model Execution
- Focus Mode v2.5 / Story Node v3 / ML-Fusion model versions  
- Hyperparameters  
- Embedding settings  
- Fusion weights  
- Scenario configuration  

### 🧮 Post-Processing
- Hydrologic smoothing  
- Drift correction  
- Variance stabilization  
- Event-sequence plausibility tests  

### 🌍 Telemetry & Governance
- Energy/carbon usage  
- Execution environment  
- CARE review metadata  
- FAIR compliance checks  
- SLSA build provenance  

---

# 👤 5. PROV-O Agents (`prov:Agent`)

Agents include:

- **Focus Mode v2.5**  
- **Story Node v3**  
- ML-Fusion engine  
- Hydrologists & scientific validators  
- Tribal water-knowledge reviewers (CARE gatekeepers)  
- ETL/lineage pipelines  
- Governance auditors  

Each agent is recorded with defined roles, authority, and accountability.

---

# 🧪 6. Validation Requirements

All AI lineage chains must pass:

- PROV-O JSON-LD schema validation  
- Hash-chain continuity  
- SBOM/SLSA verification  
- Hydrologic plausibility testing  
- Temporal alignment audits  
- CARE cultural governance review  
- ASCII-based reproducibility checks  

No lineage enters the archive unless **fully validated**.
