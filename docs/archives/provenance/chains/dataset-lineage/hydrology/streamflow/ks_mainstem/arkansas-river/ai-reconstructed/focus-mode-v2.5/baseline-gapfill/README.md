# 🤖💧 Kansas Frontier Matrix — **Baseline Gap-Fill Lineage (Focus Mode v2.5 · Arkansas River)**

This directory contains the **authoritative PROV-O lineage chains** for  
**baseline gap-fill hydrologic reconstructions** generated by  
**Focus Mode v2.5** for the Arkansas River streamflow archive.

Gap-fill lineage records describe how missing or corrupted flow periods were  
reconstructed using **physics-aware**, **statistical**, and **neuro-symbolic**  
methods, maintaining strict hydrologic continuity and FAIR+CARE governance.

Focus Mode v2.5 restores:

- Multi-month to multi-year gauge outages  
- Incomplete early-digital hydrology  
- Missing transitions during instrument replacements  
- Corrupted readings from mechanical or digital failure  
- Disruptions from reservoir operations & ice-affected flows  

All reconstructions comply with **SBOM/SLSA**, **PROV-O**, **lineage immutability**,  
and **ASCII-only reproducibility** mandates.

├── README.md                     ← this file
└── lineage.jsonld                ← immutable PROV-O JSON-LD lineage graph

`lineage.jsonld` is the **single source of truth** for reconstruction lineage.

# 🧠 2. Gap-Fill Reconstruction Overview

### 🧩 Temporal Reconstruction  
- Long-memory hydrologic embeddings  
- Event continuity preservation (flood pulses, recession curves)  
- Flow-regime consistency across decades  

### 🛰 Multi-Source Conditioning  
- Satellite discharge proxies  
- Climate indices (ENSO, PDO, PDSI, SPI)  
- Precipitation/soil-moisture composites  
- Upstream/downstream gauge correlation  

### 🌊 Physical Constraints  
- Hydrograph shape integrity  
- Mass-balance approximations  
- Seasonal cycle preservation  
- Flood/drought expected bounds  

### 🔬 Statistical + Neural Fusion  
- Bayesian smoothing  
- Neural autoregressive modeling  
- Outlier-resistant interpolation  
- Uncertainty quantification

# 🧬 3. PROV-O Entity Requirements (`prov:Entity`)

Each entity documents a dataset state and must include:

- SHA-256 digest  
- Timestamp of inference  
- Temporal + spatial extent of reconstruction  
- CARE metadata (tribal-water sensitivity classification)  
- STAC/DCAT descriptors  
- SBOM/SLSA references  
- Uncertainty channel (sigma or posterior metadata)  
- ASCII-only reproduction instructions  
- Upstream/downstream data dependencies  

---

# ⚙️ 4. PROV-O Activity Requirements (`prov:Activity`)

Each reconstruction activity logs:

### 🔧 Inference Operation  
- Focus Mode v2.5 build signature  
- Hyperparameters  
- Context window  
- Conditioning data sources  
- Domain-aware heuristics applied  

### 🧮 Post-Processing  
- Hydrologic smoothing  
- Drift correction  
- Range-conformance tests  
- Uncertainty propagation  

### 🌍 Execution Telemetry  
- CPU/GPU environment  
- Energy/carbon totals  
- Runtime metadata

# 👤 5. PROV-O Agent Requirements (`prov:Agent`)

Agents include:

- **Focus Mode v2.5** (primary inference agent)  
- Hydrologists & reviewers  
- Tribal cultural reviewers (CARE authority)  
- KFM lineage engine  
- ETL pipelines  
- Governance auditors  

Each agent includes role, authority domain, and responsibility.

---

# 🧪 6. Validation Requirements

All gap-fill lineages must pass:

- PROV-O JSON-LD schema checks  
- Full SHA-256 hash-chain validation  
- SBOM/SLSA verification  
- Hydrologic plausibility tests  
- Temporal continuity audits  
- CARE governance review  
- Synthetic rebuild (byte-identical output)  

Only fully validated chains enter KFM Archives.

# 🔎 7. Retrieval Examples (v11.2+)

```
kfm provenance chains expand --dataset hydrology/streamflow/ks_mainstem/arkansas-river/ai-reconstructed/focus-mode-v2.5/baseline-gapfill
kfm provenance chains reconstruct --id hydrology/.../arkansas-river/ai-reconstructed/baseline-gapfill
kfm provenance chains agent --name "FocusMode v2.5"
```

# 🔮 8. Roadmap (v11.3–v12.0)

- Focus Mode v3.0 reinforcement-learned hydrologic gap-filling  
- Multi-source ensemble lineage (FMv2.5 × ML-Fusion × Story Node v3)  
- Basin-wide temporal fusion lineage (Arkansas → Kansas → Neosho)  
- 4D flow–uncertainty lineage visualization  
- CARE-restricted cultural hydrology reconstruction extensions  

---

# 📚 9. Version History

- **v11.0.2** — Regenerated with full KFM-MDP v11 footer & metadata rules  
- **v11.0.1** — Initial Arkansas River gap-fill lineage entry
