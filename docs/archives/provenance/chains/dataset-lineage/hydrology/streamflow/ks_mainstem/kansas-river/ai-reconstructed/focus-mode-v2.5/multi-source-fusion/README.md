# 🤖🌐 Kansas Frontier Matrix — **Multi-Source Fusion Lineage (Focus Mode v2.5 · Kansas River)**

This directory contains the **complete PROV-O lineage chains** for  
**multi-source fusion hydrologic reconstructions** generated by **Focus Mode v2.5**  
for the Kansas River streamflow archives.

These reconstructions integrate **multiple hydrologic evidence streams**, producing  
high-fidelity, uncertainty-aware estimates that merge:

- Gauge station records  
- Upstream/downstream correlation patterns  
- Satellite hydrometry (river width / discharge proxies)  
- Climate teleconnections (ENSO, PDO, PDSI, SPI)  
- Soil moisture & evapotranspiration indices  
- Hydrologic model outputs (HEC-HMS, SWAT, VIC)  
- Historical analog gage book transcriptions  
- Story Node v3 generative priors (when available)

Focus Mode v2.5 fuses these sources using **physically constrained reasoning**,  
**statistical priors**, and **neuro-symbolic hydrologic embeddings**.

All results are **FAIR+CARE governed**, **hash-verified**,  
and **fully reconstructible** per MCP-DL v6.3.

# 🌐 2. Overview of Multi-Source Fusion Reconstructions

Focus Mode v2.5 uses a **hierarchical fusion engine** combining physics, statistics,  
and deep neural hydrology.

### 🛰️ Satellite–Gauge Fusion
- Harmonizes discharge estimates from satellite width/velocity proxies  
- Aligns remote sensing periods with known gauge regimes  
- Introduces physical priors for extreme events  

### 🌧️ Climate-Conditioned Fusion
- Uses ENSO/PDO/NAO indices  
- Integrates precipitation, drought, and soil-moisture signals  
- Applies climate-influenced flow-distribution priors  

### 🌊 Model-Enhanced Fusion
- Merges outputs from HEC-HMS, SWAT, and VIC  
- Resolves disagreements using basin-scale consistency checks  
- Preserves flood/drought characteristics  

### 📚 Historical Series Fusion
- References early 20th-century analog logs  
- Corrects early-era biases  
- Maintains continuity across century-scale trend transitions  

### 🤖 Neuro-Symbolic Fusion
- Uses Focus Mode v2.5 hydrologic adapters  
- Context-aware embeddings for long-term flow regimes  
- Story Node v3 priors when multi-decadal patterns require interpolation
