# 🤖💧 Kansas Frontier Matrix — **Anomaly-Smoothing Lineage (Focus Mode v2.5 · Republican River)**

This directory contains the **complete PROV-O lineage chains** for  
**anomaly-smoothing hydrologic reconstructions** performed by  
**Focus Mode v2.5** on the Republican River streamflow datasets.

Anomaly smoothing corrects hydrologic irregularities such as:

- Spurious flood spikes  
- Ice-affected artificial low-flow readings  
- Sensor malfunction dropouts  
- Cross-station inconsistencies  
- Erratic drought-era anomalies  
- Digitization distortions in early and mid-century hydrographs  

Focus Mode v2.5 performs a **hydrology-aware** smoothing process  
that preserves basin behavior while removing physically implausible signals.

# 📁 1. Directory Layout (DL-C Compliant)

```
docs/.../anomaly-smoothing/
├── README.md                     ← this file
└── lineage.jsonld                ← definitive PROV-O JSON-LD lineage graph
```

The `lineage.jsonld` file is the authoritative, immutable record of all  
Entity–Activity–Agent relationships for anomaly-smoothing transformations.

# 🧠 2. Overview of Anomaly-Smoothing Reconstruction

### 🌀 Hydrologic Anomaly Detection  
- Flood-spike identification  
- Low-flow ice-period classification  
- Multi-station discrepancy mapping  
- Seasonal misalignment checks  

### 🔧 Domain-Aware Smoothing  
- Bayesian & physical smoothing  
- Hydrograph shape preservation  
- Seasonal-flow cycle maintenance  
- Flow-regime consistency rules  

### 🌐 Multi-Source Intelligence

# 🧬 3. PROV-O Entity Requirements (`prov:Entity`)

Each dataset state must include:

- SHA-256 hash  
- Spatial & temporal coverage  
- CARE metadata (tribal sensitivity classification)  
- Uncertainty metadata (sigma/posterior)  
- STAC/DCAT descriptors  
- SBOM binding  
- ASCII-only reconstruction instructions  
- Dependencies on climate, satellite, or gauge inputs  

---

# ⚙️ 4. PROV-O Activity Requirements (`prov:Activity`)

Activities include:

### 🔎 Detection  
- Thresholds for anomaly detection  
- Pattern identification parameters  
- Seasonal baseline comparison  
- Sensor-noise categorization  

### 🧮 Smoothing  
- Hyperparameters for smoothing models  
- Time-window configuration  
- Event-preservation weights  
- Drift correction factors  
- Uncertainty propagation logic  

### 🌍 Telemetry  
- Carbon/energy usage  
- Execution environment metadata  
- SLSA provenance  

### 🧭 Governance  
- CARE cultural review  
- FAIR compliance  
- Access restrictions & licensing

# 👤 5. PROV-O Agents (`prov:Agent`)

Agents include:

- **Focus Mode v2.5**  
- Hydrology subject-matter validators  
- Digitization/archival specialists  
- Climate-data stewards  
- Tribal cultural governance reviewers  
- Governance auditors  
- KFM lineage engine  

Each agent features explicit role, authority, and responsibility metadata.

---

# 🧪 6. Validation Requirements

Anomaly-smoothing lineage must pass:

- PROV-O JSON-LD schema validation  
- SHA-256 chain verification  
- SBOM/SLSA integrity checks  
- Hydrologic plausibility tests (flood/drought continuity)  
- Climate/flow consistency checks  
- CARE cultural governance review  
- Complete ASCII-only reproducibility validation  

Only **perfectly valid** lineage chains enter the KFM archive.

# 🔎 7. Retrieval Examples (v11.2+)

```
kfm provenance chains expand --dataset hydrology/streamflow/ks_mainstem/republican-river/ai-reconstructed/focus-mode-v2.5/anomaly-smoothing
kfm provenance chains reconstruct --id hydrology/.../republican-river/anomaly-smoothing
kfm provenance chains agent --name "FocusMode v2.5"
```

# 🔮 8. Roadmap (v11.3–v12.0)

- AI-powered basin-wide anomaly heatmaps  
- Seasonal anomaly-frequency lineage analysis  
- Multi-era anomaly continuity modeling  
- CARE-sensitive cultural hydrology anomaly overlays  
- Integration with Story Node v3 narrative scenario timelines
