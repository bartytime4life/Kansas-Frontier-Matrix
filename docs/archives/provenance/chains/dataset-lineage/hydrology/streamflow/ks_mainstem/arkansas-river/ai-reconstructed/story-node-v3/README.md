# 📜🌊 Kansas Frontier Matrix — **Arkansas River Story Node v3 Hydrologic Narrative Lineage**

This directory contains the **complete PROV-O lineage chains** for  
**Story Node v3–generated hydrologic narratives** applied to the  
Arkansas River streamflow archives.

Story Node v3 is KFM’s **temporal–narrative generative engine**, capable of  
producing **scenario-conditioned**, **culturally aware**, and  
**physically plausible hydrologic sequences** that blend domain physics,  
historical baselines, climate drivers, and narrative embeddings.

Story Node v3 is used to:

- Reconstruct missing hydrologic periods via narrative-temporal inference  
- Generate climate-driven “what-if” scenarios  
- Create ensemble hydrologic narratives aligned with basin behavior  
- Support ecological, cultural, and water-governance storytelling  
- Integrate flood/drought narratives with physical hydrology  
- Provide AI-generated context for long-term flow simulation  

All outputs are **FAIR+CARE governed**, **SBOM/SLSA notarized**, **hash-verified**,  
and **reconstructible** via ASCII-only instructions.

`lineage.jsonld` stores the **immutable narrative lineage graph** for  
Story Node v3 hydrologic reconstructions.

# 🧭 2. Hydrologic Narrative Generation Overview

### 🧠 Narrative–Temporal Embeddings  
- Learns basin-specific hydrologic rhythm  
- Encodes seasonal flood/drought cycles  
- Embeds climate signatures across decades  

### 🌧 Climate-Scenario Conditioning  
- ENSO/PDO modulated flows  
- Warm-season and snowmelt-influenced hydrology  
- Past-to-future cross-era continuity  

### 🌊 Physical Hydrology Alignment  
- Flow-regime realism (no impossible spikes or lows)  
- Conservation of flood sequences  
- Recession curve behavior  
- Consistency with upstream/downstream stations  

### 🪶 Cultural Water Narratives (CARE-Coordinated)  
- Tribal seasonal water knowledge  
- Indigenous ecological cues  
- Cultural hydrology sequences  
- Restricted metadata carefully encoded  

### 🔢 Uncertainty-Aware Generation  
- Sigma or posterior variance tracking  
- Narrative ensemble creation  
- Synthetic multi-run hydrology with confidence bounds  

---

# 🧬 3. PROV-O Entity Requirements (`prov:Entity`)

Each narrative dataset state must include:

- SHA-256 digest  
- Temporal & spatial coverage  
- Narrative embedding metadata  
- CARE sensitivity flags  
- STAC/DCAT descriptors  
- Uncertainty representation  
- SBOM/SLSA references  
- ASCII-only reconstruction steps  

---

# ⚙️ 4. PROV-O Activity Requirements (`prov:Activity`)

Narrative-generation activities capture:

### 🧠 Generative Operation  
- Story Node v3 model version  
- Prompt lineage  
- Scenario configuration  
- Climate driver inputs  
- Embedding space parameters  

### 🧮 Post-Processing  
- Hydrologic smoothing  
- Flow-regime preservation  
- Cross-station continuity tests  
- Event-sequence plausibility checks  

### 🌍 Telemetry  
- Compute environment  
- Carbon/energy usage  
- Deterministic seed and runtime metadata  

---

# 👤 5. PROV-O Agents (`prov:Agent`)

Agents documented include:

- **Story Node v3** (primary AI agent)  
- Focus Mode v2.5 (context provider when used)  
- Hydrologists validating outputs  
- Tribal cultural review boards (CARE-controlled)  
- ETL & lineage validation pipelines  
- Governance reviewers  

Each agent includes a full authority and accountability trace.

---

# 🧪 6. Validation Requirements

Narrative lineage must pass:

- PROV-O JSON-LD schema verification  
- SHA-256 hash-chain continuity  
- SBOM/SLSA attestation validation  
- Hydrologic plausibility tests  
- Narrative coherence checks  
- CARE cultural governance review  
- Full reconstructibility audit (byte-identical rebuild)  

Only **zero-error** narrative lineages enter the archive.

# 🔎 7. Retrieval Examples (v11.2+)

```
kfm provenance chains expand --dataset hydrology/.../arkansas-river/ai-reconstructed/story-node-v3
kfm provenance chains reconstruct --id hydrology/.../story-node-v3
kfm provenance chains agent --name "Story Node v3"
```

# 🔮 8. Roadmap (v11.3–v12.0)

- Climate-conditioned multi-decade hydrology narratives  
- Cross-basin narrative lineage fusion (Arkansas → Kansas → Neosho)  
- 4D narrative hydrology visualization (time × flow × context × uncertainty)  
- Enhanced CARE-governed cultural-water lineage integration  
- Story Node v4 generative hydrology (research preview)  

---

# 📚 9. Version History

- **v11.0.1** — First Story Node v3 Arkansas River lineage file  
- **v10.x** — Experimental narrative reconstructions archived under early governance
