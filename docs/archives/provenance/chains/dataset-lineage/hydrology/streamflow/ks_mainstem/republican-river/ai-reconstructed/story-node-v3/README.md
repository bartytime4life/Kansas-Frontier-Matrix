# 📜🌊 Kansas Frontier Matrix — **Republican River Story Node v3 Hydrologic Narrative Lineage**

This directory contains the **authoritative PROV-O lineage chains** for  
**Story Node v3 hydrologic narrative reconstructions** applied to the  
**Republican River** dataset within the Kansas Frontier Matrix.

Story Node v3 is KFM’s **temporal–narrative generative engine**.  
It produces **scenario-conditioned**, **physically plausible**, and  
**culturally aware** hydrologic sequences designed to:

- Reconstruct missing intervals using narrative-temporal inference  
- Generate “what-if” climate-driven hydrologic scenarios  
- Support ecological & cultural hydrology storytelling  
- Provide multi-sample flow ensembles with uncertainty  
- Bridge historical, modern, and simulated futures in one lineage chain  

Story Node v3 outputs are **governed**, **culturally reviewed**,  
**physically validated**, and **reconstructible** using ASCII-only instructions.

# 📁 1. Directory Layout (DL-C Compliant)

```
docs/.../story-node-v3/
├── README.md                     ← this file
└── lineage.jsonld                ← narrative reconstruction PROV-O graph
```

The `lineage.jsonld` file is the **immutable, cryptographically validated**  
provenance chain representing all Entity–Activity–Agent relationships  
in the narrative hydrologic generation process.

# 🧭 2. Overview of Story Node v3 Hydrologic Narratives

### 🧠 Narrative Temporal Embeddings
- Learns basin hydrologic rhythms  
- Encodes flood/drought seasonality  
- Models long-memory hydrologic dependencies  

### 🌧 Climate-Scenario Conditioning
- ENSO/PDO/SPI/PDSI climate signatures  
- Historical-to-projected flow transitions  
- Scenario-based reconstructions for extremes  

### 🌊 Physical Hydrology Alignment
- Hydrograph shape realism  
- Baseflow, recession, and peak-flow continuity  
- Cross-station spatial hydrologic coherence  

### 🪶 Cultural Hydrology (CARE-Controlled)
- Incorporates tribal water knowledge when approved  
- Embeds cultural water-season narratives  
- Applies CARE restrictions and sensitivity metadata  

### 🔢 Uncertainty-Aware Ensemble Generation
- Posterior variance metadata  
- Multiple scenario sample outputs  
- Ensemble-based hydrologic narrative sets  

---

# 🧬 3. PROV-O Entity Requirements (`prov:Entity`)

Each Story Node v3 dataset state includes:

- SHA-256 digest  
- Temporal/spatial extent  
- Narrative-embedding metadata  
- CARE metadata (permissions, cultural tags)  
- STAC/DCAT descriptors  
- Uncertainty representation  
- ASCII-only reconstruction instructions  
- SBOM reference  
- Climate & satellite dependency links  

---

# ⚙️ 4. PROV-O Activity Requirements (`prov:Activity`)

Activities describe:

### 🧠 Narrative Generation
- Story Node v3 model version  
- Prompt lineage  
- Climate drivers used  
- Scenario configuration  
- Embedding hyperparameters  

### 🧮 Post-Processing
- Hydrologic smoothing  
- Event-sequence plausibility tests  
- Spatial-flow consistency corrections  
- Uncertainty refinement  

### 🌍 Telemetry
- Energy/carbon metrics  
- Execution environment  
- Deterministic seed metadata  

### 🧭 Governance
- CARE cultural review  
- FAIR metadata validation  
- SLSA provenance  
- Access restrictions & licensing controls  

---

# 👤 5. PROV-O Agents (`prov:Agent`)

Agents include:

- **Story Node v3** (primary narrative generator)  
- Focus Mode v2.5 (context provider when applicable)  
- Hydrologists & environmental reviewers  
- Tribal cultural stewards (CARE restricted)  
- ETL/lineage validation engine  
- Governance auditors  

Roles, authorities, and responsibilities are explicitly recorded.

---

# 🧪 6. Validation Requirements

Narrative lineage must pass:

- PROV-O JSON-LD validation  
- SHA-256 hash-chain integrity  
- SBOM/SLSA verification  
- Hydrologic plausibility tests  
- Narrative–hydrology coherence validation  
- CARE cultural governance review  
- ASCII-only reconstructibility audit  

Only **zero-error** narrative lineages are admitted to KFM.

# 🔎 7. Retrieval Examples (v11.2+)

```
kfm provenance chains expand --dataset hydrology/streamflow/ks_mainstem/republican-river/ai-reconstructed/story-node-v3
kfm provenance chains reconstruct --id hydrology/.../story-node-v3
kfm provenance chains agent --name "Story Node v3"
```

---

# 🔮 8. Roadmap (v11.3–v12.0)

- Climate-conditioned multi-scenario narrative networks  
- Basin-wide narrative lineage fusion (CO → NE → KS)  
- CARE-restricted cultural hydrology narrative integration  
- 4D hydrologic–narrative visualization (time × flow × culture × uncertainty)  
- Story Node v4 generative hydrology expansion  

---

# 📚 9. Version History

- **v11.0.1** — First Republican River Story Node v3 lineage file (KFM-MDP v11 compliant)  
- **v10.x** — Early narrative experiments preserved under legacy structures
