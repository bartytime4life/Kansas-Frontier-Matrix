# 🤖🌊 Kansas Frontier Matrix — **Kansas River AI-Reconstructed Streamflow Lineage**

This directory contains the **AI-generated and AI-enhanced streamflow lineage chains**  
for the **Kansas River**, documenting reconstructions produced by:

- **Focus Mode v2.5** (gap-filling + anomaly smoothing)  
- **Story Node v3** (temporal hydrologic scenario generation)  
- **Hydro-ML composite models** (multi-source fusion)  
- **AI-assisted paleohydrologic inference**  
- **Domain-guided neural reconstructions (KFM hydrology adapters)**  

These reconstructions repair missing records, harmonize historic data, and generate  
consistent hydrologic time-series that align with real-world basin behavior.

Every AI-generated dataset is:

- ⚙️ PROV-O JSON-LD documented  
- 🔐 Hash-verified  
- 🧬 SBOM/SLSA notarized  
- ⚖️ FAIR+CARE compliant  
- 🧾 Fully reconstructible (ASCII-only instructions)  
- 🛰️ Crosslinked with STAC/DCAT spatial-temporal metadata

# 🧠 2. Overview of AI Reconstruction Approaches

## 🤖 Focus Mode v2.5  
Used for:

- Gap-filling multi-year missing periods  
- Hydrologic anomaly smoothing  
- Temporal station harmonization  
- Bias correction for low-flow and high-flow extremes  

Metadata includes:

- Reasoning logs  
- Parameter traces  
- Energy/carbon telemetry  
- Input sources & uncertainty propagation  

---

## 🌀 Story Node v3  
Used for:

- Scenario-based generative hydrology  
- "What-if" reconstructions aligned to climate drivers  
- Backcasting synthetic hydrologic behavior  
- Time-evolving flow narratives (multi-timestep generation)  

Metadata includes:

- Prompt lineage  
- Narrative-temporal embeddings  
- Generator configuration & SLSA attestations  

---

## 🔬 ML Fusion Models  
Used for:

- Multi-source proxy integration (satellite + gauge + climate indices)  
- Hybrid physical–neural hydrology  
- Reconstruction of degraded sensors  
- Long-term trend realignment  

Metadata includes:

- Model architecture (ASCII-only)  
- Training hyperparameters  
- Loss curves  
- Reconstruction uncertainty

# 🧬 3. PROV-O Requirements

Each AI-reconstructed dataset must include:

### `prov:Entity`  
Each state documents:

- SHA-256 hash  
- Data schema  
- Spatial/temporal extent  
- CARE metadata  
- SBOM link  
- Provenance notes  
- ASCII-only reconstruction protocol  

### `prov:Activity`  
AI activities include:

- Reasoning cycles  
- Model execution  
- Data fusion processes  
- Post-processing steps  

Each includes:

- Hyperparameters  
- Execution environment  
- Model version  
- Carbon/energy use  

### `prov:Agent`  
Agents include:

- Focus Mode v2.5  
- Story Node v3  
- Human validators  
- ETL pipelines  
- Governance reviewers  

Every agent is documented with role, authority, and responsibility.

# 🧪 4. Validation Requirements

AI reconstructions must pass:

- PROV-O JSON-LD validation  
- SBOM + SLSA integrity checks  
- Temporal coherence validation  
- Hydrologic plausibility assessment  
- CARE-compliant review (especially where tribal water rights apply)  
- Rebuild test (binary-identical output from instructions)

# 🔎 5. Retrieval Examples (v11.2+)

```
kfm provenance chains expand --dataset hydrology/streamflow/ks_mainstem/kansas-river/ai-reconstructed/focus-mode-v2.5
kfm provenance chains reconstruct --id hydrology/.../kansas-river/ai-reconstructed/story-node-v3
kfm provenance chains agent --name "FocusMode v2.5"
```

---

# 🔮 6. Roadmap (v11.3–v12.0)

- Multi-model AI lineage fusion  
- Temporal generative consistency validation  
- Cross-basin AI reconstruction benchmarking  
- 3D hydrologic scenario visualization  
- Tribal-led AI review boards (CARE-restricted)  

---

# 📚 7. Version History

- **v11.0.1** — First AI lineage directory for Kansas River datasets  
- **v10.x** — Early experiments preserved as pre-KFM archives
