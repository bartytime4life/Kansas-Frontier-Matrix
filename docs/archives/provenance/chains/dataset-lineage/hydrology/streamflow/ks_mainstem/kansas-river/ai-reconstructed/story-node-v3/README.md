# 📜🌊 Kansas Frontier Matrix — **Story Node v3 Lineage (Kansas River Hydrologic Reconstructions)**

This directory stores the **complete PROV-O lineage chains** for  
**Story Node v3–generated hydrologic reconstructions** of the Kansas River.  
Story Node v3 is KFM’s **temporal–narrative generative engine**, capable of producing  
**physically plausible**, **context-sensitive**, and **scenario-driven** hydrologic sequences.

These reconstructions serve to:

- Rebuild missing records using narrative-temporal embeddings  
- Generate climate-conditioned “what-if” flow scenarios  
- Produce basin-consistent generative hydrology  
- Align reconstructions with historical, cultural, and ecological context  
- Support long-term hydrologic storytelling across time  
- Provide uncertainty-aware synthetic sequences for simulations  

All Story Node v3 outputs are **FAIR+CARE-governed**, **SLSA-notarized**,  
and **bitwise reproducible** using ASCII-only instructions.

# 🧭 2. Overview of Story Node v3 Hydrologic Narratives

Story Node v3 generates hydrology-driven narrative reconstructions using:

### 🧠 Narrative Temporal Embeddings  
- Learns basin-specific flow rhythm  
- Encodes seasonal flood/drought fingerprints  
- Models long-memory hydrologic dependencies  

### 🌧 Climate-Scenario Conditioning  
- ENSO/PDO drivers  
- Paleoclimate and future-stochastic patterns  
- Teleconnection-informed flow modulation  

### 🌊 Hydrologic Coherence Modeling  
- Conservation across reaches  
- Flood-wave propagation realism  
- Flow-regime continuity enforcement  

### 📜 Contextual Narrative Guidance  
- Cultural and tribal water histories  
- Historical drought/flood narratives  
- Ecological habitat hydrology  

### 🔢 Uncertainty-Aware Generation  
- Posterior variance representation  
- Scenario ensembles  
- Multi-sample hydrologic narrative sets

# 🧬 3. PROV-O Lineage Requirements

Each Story Node v3 lineage file includes:

## `prov:Entity`
Each dataset state defines:

- SHA-256 hash  
- Temporal & spatial extents  
- CARE metadata (if cultural hydrology is involved)  
- Narrative embedding metadata  
- STAC/DCAT references  
- SBOM + SLSA references  
- ASCII-only reconstruction protocol  
- Uncertainty representation (sigma or posterior form)  

---

## `prov:Activity`
Narrative generation activities document:

- Conditioning inputs (climate indices, flows, models, cultural metadata)  
- Narrative–hydrologic embedding used  
- Hyperparameters & scenario configuration  
- Generative model version  
- Execution environment details  
- Carbon/energy telemetry  
- Post-generation smoothing/validation  

---

## `prov:Agent`
Agents include:

- **Story Node v3**  
- Focus Mode v2.5 (when providing upstream context)  
- Hydrologists & ecological validators  
- Tribal/community cultural review boards  
- Governance auditors  
- ETL + lineage engine services  

Each agent carries explicit role & authority metadata.

---

# 🧪 4. Validation Requirements

All Story Node v3 reconstructions must pass:

- PROV-O JSON-LD schema validation  
- Hash-chain verification  
- Hydrologic plausibility validation (flood/drought behavior)  
- Narrative coherence checks  
- CARE compliance review (cultural hydrology)  
- Cross-source consistency checks  
- Synthetic rebuild verification  

Nothing is accepted unless **100% validation** is achieved.

# 🔎 5. Retrieval Examples (v11.2+)

```
kfm provenance chains expand --dataset hydrology/.../story-node-v3
kfm provenance chains reconstruct --id hydrology/.../story-node-v3
kfm provenance chains agent --name "Story Node v3"
```

---

# 🔮 6. Roadmap (v11.3–v12.0)

- Multi-scenario hydrologic narrative branching  
- Cross-basin Story Node lineage fusion  
- 4D hydrology–narrative visualization (time × flow × context × uncertainty)  
- AI-enhanced cultural hydrology generative review  
- Federated narrative archives with tribal institutions  

---

# 📚 7. Version History

- **v11.0.1** — First lineage file for Story Node v3 hydrologic reconstructions  
- **v10.x** — Pre-KFM narrative prototypes retained in legacy archive
