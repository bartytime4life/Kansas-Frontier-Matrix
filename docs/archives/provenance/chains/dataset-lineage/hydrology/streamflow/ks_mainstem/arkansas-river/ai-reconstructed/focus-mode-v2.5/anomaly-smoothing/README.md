# 🤖💧 Kansas Frontier Matrix — **Anomaly-Smoothing Lineage (Focus Mode v2.5 · Arkansas River)**

This directory contains the **complete PROV-O lineage chains** for  
**anomaly-smoothing hydrologic reconstructions** generated by  
**Focus Mode v2.5** for Arkansas River streamflow datasets.

Anomaly smoothing corrects irregularities that distort physical hydrology,  
including:

- Spurious flood spikes  
- Ice-affected low-flow artifacts  
- Sensor malfunction dropouts  
- Erratic drought-period metrics  
- Multi-station conflicts  
- Digitization distortions from older strip-chart archives  

Focus Mode v2.5 applies **hydrology-aware**, **statistical**, and  
**neuro-symbolic** smoothing methods while enforcing basin-scale realism  
and FAIR+CARE governance restrictions.

├── README.md                     ← this file
└── lineage.jsonld                ← authoritative PROV-O JSON-LD lineage graph

The `lineage.jsonld` file contains the immutable Entity–Activity–Agent  
graph for all anomaly-smoothing operations performed on this dataset.

# 🧠 2. Overview of Anomaly-Smoothing Reconstruction

### 🌀 Hydrologic Anomaly Detection  
- Detection of unnatural spikes/dips  
- Multi-gauge discrepancy analysis  
- Ice-affected flow pattern identification  
- Comparative correlation with upstream/downstream gauges  

### 🔧 Probabilistic Smoothing  
- Bayesian smoothing of time-series  
- Noise-model alignment  
- Seasonal-cycle reinforcement  
- Flow-regime consistency preservation  

### 🌊 Physical & Domain Constraints  
- Hydrograph shape integrity rules  
- Minimum/maximum bound constraints  
- Flood/drought regime coherence  
- Reservoir influence filtering  

### 🌐 Multi-Source Reasoning  
- Climate drivers (ENSO, PDO, drought indices)  
- Satellite hydrometry  
- Soil moisture and precipitation fields  
- Historical baseline comparison

# 🧬 3. PROV-O Entity Requirements (`prov:Entity`)

Each entity state must record:

- SHA-256 digest  
- Timestamp  
- Spatial/temporal coverage  
- CARE metadata (cultural water sensitivity)  
- STAC/DCAT descriptors  
- Smoothing uncertainty representation  
- SBOM reference  
- ASCII-only reconstruction instructions  
- Dependencies (climate, satellite, gauge sources)  

---

# ⚙️ 4. PROV-O Activity Requirements (`prov:Activity`)

Each activity node documents:

### 🔎 Detection Stage  
- Spike/low anomaly thresholds  
- Drift patterns  
- Seasonal misalignment metrics  
- Activity parameters used for detection  

### 🧮 Smoothing Stage  
- Model hyperparameters  
- Time-window settings  
- Fusion or interpolation strategy  
- Uncertainty propagation factors  

### 🌍 Environment & Telemetry  
- Compute environment  
- Energy/carbon metrics  
- Tooling versions (SBOM)  

### 🧭 Governance Considerations  
- CARE review status  
- Cultural sensitivity classification  
- Usage restrictions

# 👤 5. PROV-O Agents (`prov:Agent`)

Agents include:

- **Focus Mode v2.5**  
- Hydrologists validating anomaly corrections  
- Digitization specialists (for historical distortions)  
- Climate-data stewards  
- Tribal cultural review boards (CARE-controlled)  
- KFM lineage engine  
- Governance & ethics audit systems  

All agents include roles, responsibilities, and authority metadata.

---

# 🧪 6. Validation Requirements

Anomaly-smoothing lineage must pass:

- PROV-O JSON-LD schema validation  
- Hash-chain continuity verification  
- SBOM/SLSA integrity checking  
- Hydrologic plausibility tests (flood, drought, recession curves)  
- CARE cultural review  
- Temporal continuity and no-artificial-distortion audit  
- Reproducibility test (byte-for-byte match)  

Only fully validated lineage chains enter the Archive.

# 🔎 7. Retrieval Examples (v11.2+)

```
kfm provenance chains expand --dataset hydrology/.../arkansas-river/ai-reconstructed/focus-mode-v2.5/anomaly-smoothing
kfm provenance chains reconstruct --id hydrology/.../anomaly-smoothing
kfm provenance chains agent --name "FocusMode v2.5"
```

# 🔮 8. Roadmap (v11.3–v12.0)

- AI-powered anomaly mapping across entire Arkansas River basin  
- 4D smoothing lineage visualization (time × flow × context × uncertainty)  
- Multi-era anomaly detection fusion  
- Cultural hydrology anomaly interpretation layer (CARE-restricted)  
- Integration with Story Node v3 climate-conditioned anomaly narratives  

---

# 📚 9. Version History

- **v11.0.1** — First anomaly-smoothing lineage entry for Arkansas River  
- **v10.x** — Pre-KFM legacy reconstruction logs
