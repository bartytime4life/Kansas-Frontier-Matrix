# 🧠 **Kansas Frontier Matrix — Focus Mode Archives (AI-Generated Datasets) (v11.2.4)**  
`docs/archives/datasets/ai-generated/focus-mode/README.md`

**Purpose**  
Define the **Focus Mode archives sub-layer** inside the AI-generated datasets family — the place where **Focus Mode narratives, summaries, and semantic corpora** are preserved as **immutable, FAIR+CARE-governed archival datasets** with full provenance and reconstruction instructions.

## 📘 Overview

The **Focus Mode Archives** capture what KFM’s Focus Mode has *said*, *highlighted*, and *explained* over time, turning:

- Inline explanations, tooltips, and overlays,  
- Long-form summaries and cross-document syntheses,  
- Highlight spans, callouts, and structured semantic notes  

into **versioned, queryable, and auditable datasets** that:

- Are **immutable** — new runs produce new snapshots, never destructive edits.  
- Are **traceable** — bound to models, source docs, and configurations via **PROV-O**.  
- Are **governed** — subject to **CARE C1** when they touch Indigenous or culturally sensitive material.  
- Are **reconstructable** — tied to SOPs, configs, and model cards so future teams can replay or audit them.

This sub-layer is a child of:

- `docs/archives/datasets/ai-generated/README.md` (AI-generated dataset layer), and  
- `docs/archives/datasets/README.md` (Archives Datasets Layer root).

## 🧭 Context

The Focus Mode archives sub-layer connects:

- **Upstream:**  
  - Focus Mode runtime components in `src/web/`, `src/api/`, and `src/ai/`.  
  - Source documents under `docs/**`, `data/**`, and their STAC/DCAT entries.  

- **Within Archives:**  
  - This directory documents how Focus Mode narrative corpora are:
    - **Normalized** (to schemas),  
    - **Indexed** (via STAC/DCAT/PROV), and  
    - **Governed** (CARE C1, data sovereignty).

- **Downstream:**  
  - Story Nodes and time-aligned narratives.  
  - Governance dashboards (e.g., how often Focus Mode touches certain sensitive corpora).  
  - Synthesis layers (e.g., cross-domain Focus corpora for hydrology, ecology, history).

The goal is to make Focus Mode’s behavior **auditable over time**, not just observed in the moment.

## 🧠 Story Node & Focus Mode Integration

This sub-layer is tightly bound to **Story Node v3** and Focus Mode itself:

- **Story Nodes**  
  - Reference archived Focus Mode corpora via `target` fields, such as:
    - `urn:kfm:corpus:focus:v11.2.4:hydrology-insight`.  
  - Use archival references to ensure time-consistent narratives when re-rendered.

- **Focus Mode**  
  - May optionally **refine** or **resummarize** from the archived corpora, instead of recomputing from raw docs, when governance allows.  
  - Uses archives as **training/evaluation corpora** for future Focus models (subject to CARE C1).

Constraints:

- Story Nodes **must not** modify archive corpora; they can only reference and describe them.  
- For Indigenous or culturally sensitive materials:
  - Story Node text must adhere to sovereignty policies.  
  - Where needed, Story Nodes may refer to higher-level summaries rather than raw or fine-grained Focus outputs.

---

## 🧪 Validation & CI/CD

Focus Mode archival datasets and docs are subject to:

- `faircare-validate.yml`  
  - CARE C1 checks on narrative content when linked to sensitive datasets.  
  - Flags potential disclosures of sensitive locations, identities, or cultural details.

- `stac-validate.yml`  
  - Ensures STAC Items that describe Focus corpora are valid and their assets reachable.  
  - Confirms extension fields (e.g., `kfm:model_id`, `kfm:source_dataset_ids`).

- `docs-lint.yml`  
  - Verifies this documentation and related files conform to **KFM-MDP v11.2.4**.

- `telemetry-export.yml`  
  - Aggregates metrics about Focus archive creation:
    - `event_type = "focus_archive_snapshot"`.  
    - `model_id`, `release`, `corpus_family`, `energy_wh`, `carbon_gco2e`, `care_tag`.

Only corpora that pass these checks and have complete metadata may be promoted to **archive**.

---

## 📦 Data & Metadata

Each Focus Mode archival snapshot (e.g., `v11.2.4`) should define at least:

- **Identity & Scope**
  - `corpus_id` (e.g., `kfm-focus-v11.2.4-core`).  
  - `title`, `description`, `release_version`.  
  - Domains covered (hydrology, climatology, ecology, historical, etc.).

- **Model & Configuration**
  - `model_id`, `model_version` (e.g., `focus_transformer_v2_1`).  
  - Configuration or SOP references (YAML, JSON, or SOP IDs).  
  - Runtime environment (container image digest, hardware class).

- **Source Linkage**
  - STAC/DCAT IDs of source datasets and documents.  
  - Document sets, filters, or selection criteria (e.g., “only hydrology analyses from 1990–2020”).

- **Ethics & Governance**
  - `care_tag` (e.g., `public`, `restricted`, `sensitive`).  
  - Sovereignty-related flags and references to governance decisions.  
  - Links to FAIR+CARE audit outputs.

- **Technical Details**
  - File formats and encodings for corpora (JSONL, parquet, etc.).  
  - Tokenization and segmentation strategies (per doc, per paragraph, sliding windows).  
  - Checksums and SBOM references.

These are typically represented in:

- STAC Item properties (`kfm:*` fields).  
- DCAT dataset fields (`dct:provenance`, `dct:creator`, etc.).  
- PROV-O description of the creation activity.

---

## 🌐 STAC, DCAT & PROV Alignment

**STAC:**

- Collections such as:
  - `kfm-archives-ai-focus-mode-core`.  
  - `kfm-archives-ai-focus-mode-hydrology`.  
- Items contain:
  - `properties.kfm:model_id` & `kfm:model_version`.  
  - `properties.kfm:source_dataset_ids` (array).  
  - `properties.kfm:care_tag`, `kfm:governance_ledger_ref`.  
  - Links to corpora assets (JSONL, parquet, PMTiles) with checksums.

**DCAT:**

- Focus corpora appear as `dcat:Dataset` entries with:
  - Clear titles and descriptions.  
  - `dcat:distribution` entries for:
    - Narrative corpora.  
    - Span tables.  
    - Topic or cluster assignments.  
    - Provenance documentation.

**PROV-O:**

- Focus archive creation = `prov:Activity`.  
- Inputs:
  - Source datasets (`prov:used`).  
  - Model and configuration entities.  
  - Any selection filters or prompts if relevant.  
- Output:
  - Corpus entity (`prov:Entity`) with `prov:wasGeneratedBy`.  
  - Revision/supersession relationships across versions (`prov:wasRevisionOf`).

---

## ⚖ FAIR+CARE & Governance

Because Focus Mode narratives can **rephrase and refocus** sensitive source content, governance is strict:

- **Findable (F1)**  
  - Archives registered with stable IDs, indexed by STAC/DCAT, and logged in governance ledgers.

- **Accessible (A1)**  
  - Access rules follow underlying data:
    - If the underlying dataset is restricted/sensitive, Focus corpora usually are too.  
    - Public corpora are only created where governance allows.

- **Interoperable (I1)**  
  - Uses open formats and standard vocabularies (STAC/DCAT/PROV, JSON, parquet).

- **Reusable (R1)**  
  - Reuse requires:
    - Understanding constraints documented here.  
    - Respecting CARE C1 decisions and licenses.

**CARE C1 details:**

- Indigenous and community stakeholders must be able to:
  - Request restrictions or additional context on Focus corpora.  
  - Review how AI narratives represent or intersect with their histories and lands.  
- Some corpora may exist only as:
  - Restricted assets, or  
  - Aggregated/obfuscated high-level summaries.
