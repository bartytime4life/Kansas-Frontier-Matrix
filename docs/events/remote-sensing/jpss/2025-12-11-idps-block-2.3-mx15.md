# 🛰️ NOAA JPSS — IDPS Block 2.3 Mx15 Algorithm Transition (2025-12-11 16:30 UTC)

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This document is the **canonical KFM event record** for the **NOAA JPSS IDPS Block 2.3 Mx15 algorithm transition** enacted at **2025-12-11T16:30:00Z**.

Within the Kansas Frontier Matrix v11 pipeline (Deterministic ETL → STAC/DCAT/PROV catalogs → Neo4j graph → API layer → React / MapLibre / Cesium → Story Nodes → Focus Mode), this file:

- Defines the **event-level contract** for how the Mx15 transition is represented.
- Anchors **provenance and calibration epoch changes** for JPSS-related datasets.
- Guides ETL, catalog, and graph-code owners on **required adjustments** around the transition boundary.
- Provides a stable reference for future **Story Nodes** and Focus Mode narratives that depend on JPSS products.

This record is **frozen** as-of the date in the header; subsequent clarifications must be captured as **new event documents**, not edits in place.

---

## 2. Event Snapshot

**Event ID:** `jpss-idps-block2.3-mx15-transition`  
**Time (UTC):** `2025-12-11T16:30:00Z`  
**Authority:** NOAA Office of Satellite and Product Operations (OSPO)  
**System:** JPSS Interface Data Processing Segment (IDPS)  
**Change:** Deployment of **Block 2.3 Mx15** algorithm bundle into operations  
**KFM Status:** **Effective calibration epoch boundary** for impacted JPSS products  

Mx15 had been **delayed multiple times** due to upstream and downstream operational dependencies. For KFM, this transition marks the start of a **new calibration epoch** for affected streams and must be modeled as such in ETL, catalogs, and graph entities.

---

## 3. Operational Impact Summary

### 3.1 Product Classes Affected

- **ATMS SDR/TDR**
  - Updated calibration coefficients and ancillary parameters.
  - Revised geolocation and Earth-location corrections.
  - Stabilization of brightness temperature computation for selected channels.

- **VIIRS SDR/EDR chains (selected products)**
  - Minor parameter and threshold updates.
  - Adjustments to **metadata packing** and quality-flag semantics.

- **Cross-sensor consistency**
  - Harmonized shared lookup tables across sensors.
  - Timing refinements in **granule production windows** and quality flags.

### 3.2 Implications for KFM

For KFM remote-sensing ingestion:

- Calibration baselines **before vs. after** `2025-12-11T16:30Z` **must not be treated as identical**.
- STAC and DCAT records for affected products require:
  - **Algorithm version fields** reflecting `"IDPS Block2.3 Mx15"`.
  - A **calibration epoch boundary** at the event time.
- Provenance and graph models must expose the **algorithm update** as a first-class entity, allowing:
  - Cross-epoch comparison.
  - Story Nodes that explicitly reference the transition.

---

## 4. Event Lineage (PROV-O / KFM-PROV)

This event is modeled as a **PROV-O activity** with associated entities and agents.

- **prov:Activity**
  - `@id`: `urn:kfm:event:jpss-idps-block2.3-mx15-transition:2025-12-11T16:30Z`
  - `prov:startedAtTime`: `2025-12-11T16:30:00Z`
  - `prov:endedAtTime`: operationally aligned with NOAA OSPO cutover window.
  - `prov:wasAssociatedWith`: `NOAA/OSPO`

- **prov:Entity (examples)**
  - Pre-Mx15 ATMS/VIIRS SDR/EDR product series.
  - Post-Mx15 ATMS/VIIRS SDR/EDR product series.
  - Algorithm specifications, LUT bundles, release notes, and administrative messages.

- **prov:Agent**
  - `NOAA/OSPO` (operational authority).
  - KFM `remote-sensing` ETL services (software agents).
  - KFM `remote-sensing` data stewards.

- **Key relations**
  - `prov:wasGeneratedBy` → post-Mx15 product series.
  - `prov:used` → pre-Mx15 products, LUTs, and ancillary data.
  - `prov:wasInformedBy` → NOAA Administrative Message Update #4 (2025-12-09).
  - `prov:influenced` → KFM ETL ingestors, calibration comparison jobs, anomaly monitors.

The canonical JSON-LD lineage capsule is stored at:

- `docs/releases/v11.2.6/provenance/jpss-idps-block2.3-mx15.jsonld`

(Exact location may be adjusted by the releases team; this path must remain discoverable from `prov_profile` tooling.)

## 6. Integration into KFM Pipelines

### 6.1 ETL Adjustments (Deterministic & Config-Driven)

Remote-sensing ETL for JPSS lives under:

- `src/pipelines/remote-sensing/`
- Configs under `configs/remote-sensing/`

Minimum requirements:

- **Calibration ledger**
  - Log calibration deltas in  
    `data/work/remote-sensing/calibration-ledger/`  
    with explicit entries for:
    - `sensor = "ATMS"` / `sensor = "VIIRS"`
    - `algorithm_version = "IDPS Block2.3 Mx15"`
    - `calibration_epoch_start = "2025-12-11T16:30:00Z"`

- **Determinism**
  - Any statistical normalization, resampling, or machine-learning correction steps must:
    - Fix and record seeds in ETL config.
    - Reference this event’s `semantic_document_id` in their provenance.

- **Run commands**
  - Representative target:
    - `make etl-remote-sensing-atms-mx15`
    - `make etl-remote-sensing-viirs-mx15`
  - Each ETL target should:
    - Write logs into `mcp/experiments/remote-sensing/<job-name>/`.
    - Attach a `run_id` that appears both in OpenLineage events and PROV bundles.

### 6.2 STAC/DCAT Catalog Updates

For affected ATMS and VIIRS STAC Items:

- **Processing metadata**
  - `processing:level = "SDR"` (or product-specific level).
  - `processing:software.name = "NOAA JPSS IDPS"`
  - `processing:software.version = "Block2.3 Mx15"`
  - `kfm:calibration_epoch = "2025-12-11T16:30:00Z"`

- **Version bumps**
  - Collections and Items that span the epoch boundary must:
    - Record the event ID (`jpss-idps-block2.3-mx15-transition`) in an appropriate `kfm:event_ids` array.
    - Increment semantic versions when any numeric values are materially impacted.

For DCAT:

- Affected `dcat:Dataset` entries are bumped to a calibration-aware version such as:
  - `v11.2.6-rs.1`
- `dct:description` or `dct:provenance` must explicitly mention:
  - The Mx15 transition.
  - The link to this event document and its PROV capsule.

### 6.3 Graph Model Adjustments (Neo4j)

Within the KFM Neo4j graph, the transition is represented using KFM-OP entities and relationships. At minimum, create:

- Nodes (illustrative labels):
  - `(:AlgorithmUpdate { id: "idps-block2.3-mx15", ... })`
  - `(:SensorStream { id: "atms" })`
  - `(:SensorStream { id: "viirs" })`

- Relationships:
  - `(:AlgorithmUpdate {id:"idps-block2.3-mx15"})-[:UPDATES]->(:SensorStream {id:"atms"})`
  - `(:AlgorithmUpdate {id:"idps-block2.3-mx15"})-[:UPDATES]->(:SensorStream {id:"viirs"})`

Additional recommended edges:

- `(:AlgorithmUpdate)-[:DEFINED_BY]->(:Document {type:"NOAA Admin Message"})`
- `(:AlgorithmUpdate)-[:RECORDED_IN]->(:KfmEventRecord {id: "kfm-doc-event-jpss-idps-mx15-2025-12-11"})`

Schema notes:

- Stable identifiers must derive from **this document’s `semantic_document_id`** and NOAA event IDs, not ad-hoc strings.
- Graph ingestion tests under `src/graph/remote-sensing/tests/` must:
  - Assert presence of the `AlgorithmUpdate` node.
  - Verify correct connectivity to impacted sensor streams.

---

## 7. Story Nodes & Focus Mode Potential

While this document is a **frozen event record**, it is a natural anchor for one or more Story Nodes, for example:

- **"When Algorithms Shift the Sky"**
- **"The JPSS Calibration Epoch of 2025"**
- **"Mx15: The Quiet Event That Changes Weather Models"**

Any Story Node derived from this event must:

- Live under `docs/story/remote-sensing/` (e.g., `docs/story/remote-sensing/jpss-mx15-epoch.md`).
- Reference this document’s `semantic_document_id` and the graph `AlgorithmUpdate` node.
- Clearly separate:
  - **Facts** (e.g., deployment time, sensors affected).
  - **Interpretation** (e.g., impacts on trend analyses).
  - **Speculation** (e.g., long-term modeling implications), if included at all.

Focus Mode integrations:

- Use the graph neighborhood around `(:AlgorithmUpdate "idps-block2.3-mx15")` to:
  - Surface affected products and calibration epochs.
  - Flag cross-epoch comparisons requiring normalization.
- Focus Mode must **never hide** the fact that a calibration change occurred; users comparing pre- and post-Mx15 data must see clear banners or warnings.

---

## 8. Notes for Downstream Users

For users of KFM remote-sensing products:

- Expect **subtle but real changes** in brightness temperatures and derived quantities, particularly in moisture-sensitive channels.
- Any **trend analysis** crossing `2025-12-11T16:30Z` must:
  - Either apply a KFM-provided cross-epoch normalization.
  - Or treat pre- and post-Mx15 segments separately and explicitly justify the comparison.

KFM provides a cross-epoch transform at:

- `src/pipelines/remote-sensing/normalization/atms_mx15_transform.py`

(Equivalent transforms for VIIRS and other affected products should follow analogous naming and documentation patterns.)
