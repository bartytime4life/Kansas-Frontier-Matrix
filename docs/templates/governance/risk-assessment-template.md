# ⚠️ **Kansas Frontier Matrix — Governance Risk Assessment Template (v2.1.1 · Tier-Ω+∞ Certified)**  
`docs/templates/governance/risk-assessment-template.md`

**Mission:** Provide a standardized risk assessment structure for **FAIR+CARE governance**, **security**, and **ethical oversight**  
within the **Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM)** — ensuring transparency, reproducibility, and continuous governance improvement.

## 📋 Metadata (Frontmatter)

Each risk assessment report must begin with the following metadata:

```yaml
---
assessment_id: "RISK_ASSESSMENT_2025_Q4"
authors: ["@kfm-governance","@kfm-security"]
review_cycle: "Quarterly"
status: "Draft | Approved | Archived"
risk_domain: ["Data Integrity","AI Ethics","Access Control"]
checksum: "sha256:a74e3bc9f17a49c8d..."
ledger_reference: "data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json"
license: "CC-BY 4.0"
---
```

---

## 🧱 1. Risk Assessment Overview

> Provide a concise description of the assessment scope and governance focus.

**Example:**  
> The Q4 2025 risk assessment focuses on data lineage validation, AI explainability, and user access control mechanisms  
> within the KFM FAIR+CARE and MCP-DL workflows. All components were audited for reproducibility and ethical compliance.

## 🧠 2. Risk Matrix Summary

| Risk ID | Category | Description | Impact | Likelihood | Risk Level | Mitigation Strategy | Owner |
|:--|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--|:--|
| **R-001** | AI Ethics | Potential bias in Focus Mode AI model output. | High | Medium | 🔴 High | Retrain with balanced dataset and add SHAP explainability logs. | @kfm-ai |
| **R-002** | Data Provenance | Missing checksum for one NOAA dataset. | Medium | Low | 🟠 Medium | Regenerate checksum and update ledger entry. | @kfm-data |
| **R-003** | Access Control | CI token permissions overly broad. | Medium | Medium | 🟠 Medium | Apply least-privilege policy and reissue tokens. | @kfm-security |
| **R-004** | Documentation | Two files missing `license` field in frontmatter. | Low | Medium | 🟡 Low | Fix metadata and rerun `policy-check.yml`. | @kfm-docs |

> 🧩 **Rule:** Each identified risk must map to a governance policy and corresponding mitigation workflow.

## 🧩 4. FAIR + CARE Integration in Risk Review

| FAIR Principle | CARE Principle | Governance Action |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Findable** | **Collective Benefit** | Publish all risk reports in open repository under CC-BY 4.0. |
| **Accessible** | **Authority to Control** | Provide community review access with proper data protections. |
| **Interoperable** | **Responsibility** | Use JSON/YAML for all risk metadata. |
| **Reusable** | **Ethics** | Version risk assessments with ledger-tracked changes. |

---

## 🧾 5. Risk Rating Scale

| Level | Symbol | Description | Response Priority |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **Critical** | 🔴 | Immediate impact; ethical or data governance breach. | Urgent |
| **High** | 🟠 | Significant risk to compliance or reproducibility. | High |
| **Medium** | 🟡 | Minor governance issue requiring remediation. | Moderate |
| **Low** | 🟢 | No ethical or structural concern. | Routine |
