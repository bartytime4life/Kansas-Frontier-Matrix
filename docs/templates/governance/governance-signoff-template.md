# üßæ **Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî Governance Sign-Off Template (v2.1.1 ¬∑ Tier-Œ©+‚àû Certified)**  
`docs/templates/governance/governance-signoff-template.md`

**Mission:** Provide a standardized and auditable **Governance Sign-Off record**  
for documenting FAIR+CARE compliance, checksum verification, and Council approvals  
within the **Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM)** governance framework.

## üìã Metadata (Frontmatter)

Each Governance Sign-Off file must include the following metadata block.

```yaml
---
signoff_id: "GOV_SIGNOFF_2025_Q4_AI_VALIDATION"
authors: ["@kfm-governance","@kfm-security"]
approved_by: ["@kfm-architecture","@kfm-docs"]
review_cycle: "Quarterly"
status: "Approved"
checksum: "sha256:91bf93a774ab42e9..."
ledger_reference: "data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json"
license: "CC-BY 4.0"

```

## üß± 1. Governance Sign-Off Context

> Provide context for what decision, dataset, or process this sign-off validates.  
> Include FAIR+CARE compliance scope, review timeline, and any linked ADRs or council reports.

**Example:**  
> This sign-off validates the ethical, technical, and governance compliance of the **AI Hazards Drift Detection Pipeline (v9.5.0)**  
> under the FAIR+CARE Tier-Œ©+‚àû certification process. The audit confirms full checksum registration and governance ledger linkage.
