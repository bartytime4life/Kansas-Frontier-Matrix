# 🧩 **Kansas Frontier Matrix — Vulnerability Management Framework**
`docs/security/vulnerability-management.md`

**Purpose:**  
Establish a structured **vulnerability detection, triage, and remediation process** across all Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM) systems, ensuring compliance with **ISO 27001**, **NIST SP 800-40r4**, and **FAIR+CARE** ethics for responsible disclosure, traceability, and transparency.

## 📘 Overview

The **KFM Vulnerability Management Framework (VMF)** coordinates discovery, validation, prioritization, and remediation of vulnerabilities across:
- Application & Infrastructure Layers  
- AI & Data Pipelines  
- External Dependencies and SBOM-linked Components  

It aligns with **FAIR+CARE ethical governance**, emphasizing **responsible disclosure**, **provenance traceability**, and **sustainability auditing** of all remediation actions.

## ⚙️ Core Vulnerability Management Process

| Phase | Description | Responsible Team | Tools / References |
|--------|--------------|------------------|--------------------|
| **Detection** | Identify vulnerabilities via automated and manual scans | DevSecOps | CodeQL, Trivy, Dependabot |
| **Triage** | Assign severity based on CVSS 3.1 + FAIR+CARE ethics | Security Council | CVSS Calculator, FAIR+CARE Audit Tool |
| **Remediation** | Apply fixes, patches, or compensating controls | Development | GitHub PRs, Change Control Workflow |
| **Validation** | Re-scan, verify patch success, and update SBOM | QA / Compliance | SPDX / CycloneDX |
| **Governance** | Log all activity and metrics to the FAIR+CARE Ledger | FAIR+CARE Council | Governance Ledger |

---

## 📊 Severity Classification Matrix

| Severity | CVSS Range | FAIR+CARE Impact | Required Response Time |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|------------------------|
| **Critical** | 9.0–10.0 | Ethics or data integrity breach | ≤ 24 hours |
| **High** | 7.0–8.9 | Could expose sensitive data | ≤ 72 hours |
| **Medium** | 4.0–6.9 | Moderate risk or dependency issue | ≤ 7 days |
| **Low** | 0.1–3.9 | Minimal user or system impact | ≤ 30 days |

All risk decisions include **FAIR+CARE justification** and energy/carbon impact metrics for sustainable operations.

## ⚖️ FAIR+CARE & ISO Security Matrix

| Principle | Implementation | Validation Source |
|------------|----------------|--------------------|
| **Findable** | All vulnerabilities tracked in Governance Ledger | GitHub Security Dashboard |
| **Accessible** | Responsible disclosure portal for public submissions | `security.md` / email |
| **Interoperable** | SPDX and CVE mappings in SBOM reports | `supply-chain.md` |
| **Reusable** | Historical remediation reports archived | FAIR+CARE Ledger |
| **Responsibility** | ISO 27001-aligned telemetry reporting | `telemetry_ref` |
| **Ethics** | FAIR+CARE-approved risk tradeoff decisions logged | FAIR+CARE Council Audit |

## 🧠 Sustainability Metrics

| Metric | Description | Value | Target | Unit |
|---------|-------------|--------|---------|------|
| **Energy (J)** | Energy per vulnerability management cycle | 13.8 | ≤ 15 | Joules |
