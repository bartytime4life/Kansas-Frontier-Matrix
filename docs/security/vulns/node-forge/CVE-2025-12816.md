# 🚨 CVE-2025-12816 — node-forge Signature Verification Bypass Vulnerability  

`docs/security/vulns/node-forge/CVE-2025-12816.md`

**Purpose:**  
Document the **node-forge ASN.1 validation flaw (CVE-2025-12816)** and define **KFM-governed mitigation, risk handling, and CI/CD enforcement** for all components relying on node-forge for cryptographic trust decisions.

</div>

---

## 📘 1. Overview

The JavaScript cryptography library **node-forge** contains a critical flaw that allows attackers to **bypass signature and certificate validation** via weaknesses in its ASN.1 parsing and structural verification.

- **Tracking ID:** `CVE-2025-12816`  
- **Severity:** High (CVSS 8.6)  
- **Component:** `node-forge` ASN.1 validation (certificate / signature workflows)  

This advisory describes:

- Impact on KFM services and dependencies  
- Required remediation actions  
- Governance and SBOM implications  

---

## ⚠️ 2. Summary of Vulnerability

A malformed ASN.1 payload can cause `asn1.validate()` in node-forge to:

- Misinterpret optional fields as required ones  
- Accept illegal structural transitions  
- Treat **forged certificates, signatures, or PKCS#12 archives as valid**  

This directly compromises applications that use node-forge for:

- TLS / PKI certificate validation  
- Signature checking  
- PKCS#7 / PKCS#12 integrity  
- Cryptographic authentication workflows  

**Impact scope:**  
Any Node.js or web application (including KFM services or tooling) that relies on node-forge for **cryptographic trust decisions** is at risk.

---

## 🧨 3. Attack Scenario (Illustrative)

An attacker can construct a malicious ASN.1 structure which:

1. Appears superficially valid but violates internal field rules.  
2. Exploits validation gaps in `asn1.validate()`.  
3. Causes node-forge to treat a **forged signature or certificate chain as authentic**.

Potential outcomes:

- Identity spoofing (impersonating services or users).  
- Session hijacking via forged tokens or certificates.  
- Tampering with encrypted content that appears integrity-protected.  
- Fake certificate acceptance in TLS-like flows.  
- Unauthorized account or service access where node-forge is part of the trust boundary.

---

## 🔍 4. Affected Versions

- **All node-forge versions prior to `1.3.2` are vulnerable.**  

Vulnerable logic resides in the ASN.1 handling code (e.g., `asn1.js`), particularly around:

- Structural validation  
- Optional vs required element handling  
- State-machine transitions in complex PKCS and certificate structures  

---

## 🛠️ 5. Fix Status

**Patched in:**

- **node-forge `v1.3.2`**  

Key remediation in the upstream release:

- Strengthened ASN.1 structural validation.  
- Correct enforcement of optional vs required fields.  
- Hardened state-machine transitions.  
- Rejection of malformed structures previously accepted as valid.

---

## ✅ 6. Required Mitigation Steps (KFM Policy)

### 6.1 Upgrade node-forge Immediately

~~~bash
npm install node-forge@^1.3.2
~~~

- All KFM-managed repositories MUST pin or range-lock to `1.3.2` or later.  
- Any deviation MUST be explicitly justified and recorded in the risk register.

### 6.2 Rebuild and Audit Dependencies

Many popular packages embed `node-forge` indirectly.

Run a dependency audit:

~~~bash
npm ls node-forge
npm audit
~~~

- Any transitive vulnerabilities must be addressed via:
  - Direct upgrades, or  
  - Overrides / resolutions, or  
  - Replacement of vulnerable libraries.

### 6.3 Revoke and Re-Issue Trust Material (If Applicable)

If your system relied on node-forge for certificate or signature validation, consider:

- Regenerating session tokens and revoking potentially compromised sessions.  
- Invalidating cached or pinned certificate chains validated via vulnerable code paths.  
- Re-signing sensitive artifacts (e.g., packages, PDFs, archives) where validation might have been bypassed.

### 6.4 Strengthen Build-Time Supply-Chain Validation

KFM CI/CD SHOULD:

- Enforce **SBOM review and SLSA-style attestations** for cryptographic components.  
- Pin critical security-related dependencies (including node-forge).  
- Add reproducible-build checks where feasible.  

Any node-forge version drift detected in SBOMs MUST trigger:

- Automated alerting, and  
- A security review before production deployment.

---

## 🔬 7. Technical Details

### 7.1 Root Cause

`asn1.validate()` fails to properly enforce:

- Sequence/Set boundaries.  
- Context-specific tag transitions.  
- Optional element expectations.  
- Illegal nesting within PKCS and related ASN.1 structures.  

As a result, **malformed objects can be parsed as “valid”** even when structurally or semantically incorrect.

### 7.2 Failure Mode

- The underlying cryptographic primitives (e.g., signature algorithms) remain sound.  
- The **trust boundary is compromised** because validation accepts attacker-crafted ASN.1 data as structurally valid, allowing forged signatures or certificates to be treated as authentic.

---

## 📦 8. Impacted Use-Cases

Any project (KFM or third-party) using node-forge for:

- SSL/TLS certificate validation.  
- PDF / PEM / CMS signature verification.  
- PKCS#12 keystore loading.  
- OAuth/OIDC token certificate chain checks.  
- S/MIME or custom ASN.1-encoded structures.  

Systems using node-forge purely for **non-validated local operations** (e.g., key generation without external input) may have reduced risk but MUST still follow upgrade policy.

---

## 📊 10. KFM Integration & Governance

Within the KFM stack, this advisory MUST be:

- Linked from the **security index** and any affected component READMEs.  
- Referenced in:
  - Release notes for affected versions.  
  - SBOMs and security attestations where node-forge appears.  
- Used as a control in:
  - Supply-chain security reviews.  
  - CI policies that enforce acceptable node-forge versions.  

Security telemetry (see `telemetry_ref`) SHOULD capture:

- Detection of vulnerable node-forge versions in builds.  
- Remediation timelines.  
- Residual risk assessments.
