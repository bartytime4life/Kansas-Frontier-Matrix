## üìö Overview

The **Governance & Ethics Matrix** defines how ethical principles, compliance checks, and provenance oversight are  
applied across the entire Kansas Frontier Matrix system.  
It provides a structured linkage between governance policies, FAIR+CARE audits, AI ethics controls, and compliance evidence.

This matrix is updated quarterly following review by the **FAIR+CARE Governance Council** and **Security & Ethics Review Board**.
