## 📘 Overview

The Ecology Results Repository holds:
- Narrative summaries of findings from species modelling, land-cover change, and ecosystem services.  
- Tabular outputs of metrics and validation.  
- Visualization exports (maps, charts) consistent with WCAG 2.1 AA.  
- Telemetry logs recording execution metadata, energy usage, provenance, and governance events.  

All results link back to their source methods and datasets, and are indexed in the global manifest for traceability.
