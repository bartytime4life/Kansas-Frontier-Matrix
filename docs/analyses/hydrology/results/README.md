# 🌊 **Kansas Frontier Matrix — Hydrology Analyses Results Repository**  
`docs/analyses/hydrology/results/README.md`

**Purpose:**  
Provide a consolidated archive of all *validated results artefacts* generated by the hydrology domain analyses within the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
This folder captures narrative synthesis, tabular outputs, visualization assets, telemetry records, and audit documentation — all governed under FAIR+CARE principles and the Master Coder Protocol v6.3 for reproducibility and ethical stewardship.

## 📘 Overview

This results repository brings together the outcome materials from hydrology analyses—such as drought–flood correlation investigations, water-balance modeling, temporal anomaly detection, and hydrologic trend assessments.  
Each artefact is produced through a documented workflow, carries metadata for provenance and versioning, and is ready for ingestion into the knowledge graph or downstream dissemination.

### Included artefact categories:
- Narrative summaries and executive findings  
- Tabular result sets (model outputs, statistical metrics, calibration summaries)  
- Visual assets (charts, maps, hydrographs, dashboards)  
- Telemetry logs (runtime metrics, energy/carbon footprint, governance audit)

Each artefact file is versioned, carries a checksum, is linked to its generating script or workflow, and is referenced in the manifest for full traceability.
