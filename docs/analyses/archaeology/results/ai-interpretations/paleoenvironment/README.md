# 🤖🌿 **AI Interpretations — Paleoenvironment**  
`docs/analyses/archaeology/results/ai-interpretations/paleoenvironment/README.md`

**Purpose:**  
Provide a FAIR+CARE–aligned, scientifically grounded, culturally safe collection of **AI-generated paleoenvironmental interpretations**, describing broad environmental patterns, long-term climate tendencies, hydrology–settlement interactions, and proxy-based environmental transitions relevant to Kansas archaeological research.

</div>

---

## 📘 Overview

These AI-generated paleoenvironment interpretations:

- explain **generalized** Holocene → Late Prehistoric climate patterns  
- summarize multi-proxy reconstructions (pollen, isotopic, sedimentological)  
- highlight hydrology, vegetation, terrain, and drought/wet cycles  
- describe ecological affordances that may influence generalized archaeological patterns  
- incorporate uncertainty and explainability (SHAP/LIME)  
- observe strict **CARE cultural governance**  
- are **non-speculative**, **non-attributional**, and **public-safe**  

AI outputs here do **not**:

- infer cultural motivations or decisions  
- attribute cultural identity or heritage ownership  
- provide sensitive environmental information tied to sacred landscapes  
- extrapolate beyond validated datasets  

All interpretations are **filtered through the AI Safety Engine** and reviewed by the FAIR+CARE Council.

## 🌡️ Climate Interpretations (`climate/`)

AI summaries include:

- general Holocene temperature patterns  
- Late Prehistoric climate stability/variability  
- regional precipitation envelopes  
- moisture-balance patterns  
- proxy-weighted environmental impacts  

Never interprets climate as determining cultural behavior.

---

## 🌊 Hydrology-Linked Interpretations (`hydrology/`)

Includes:

- paleo-river dynamics  
- terrace/alluvial hydrology stability  
- floodplain/soil moisture interactions  
- long-term hydrology influencing generalized settlement patterns  

Spatial outputs are H3 generalized.

---

## 🌱 Vegetation & Ecosystem Narratives (`vegetation/`)

AI describes:

- prairie/woodland transition zones  
- ecozone shifts  
- biomass productivity tendencies  
- ecological affordances  

These are environmental-only interpretations.

---

## ❄️☀️ Seasonal Narratives (`seasonality/`)

Summaries include:

- winter mobility constraints  
- summer growing-season tendencies  
- seasonal hydrology balance  
- resource availability windows  

All temporal interpretations use OWL-Time intervals.

---

## 🌵 Drought & Wet Cycle Narratives (`drought-cycles/`)

AI explains:

- drought oscillation patterns  
- wet-cycle reconstructions  
- multi-proxy consensus zones  
- temporal drought intensity  

Never links drought cycles to cultural outcomes.

---

## 🌾 Environmental Affordance Narratives (`environmental-affordances/`)

Highlight:

- climate-linked affordances  
- terrain/soil/hydrology combinations  
- generalized land-use potential  
- corridor-related ecological suitability  

---

## 🕰️ Temporal Paleoenvironment (`temporal/`)

AI interprets broad environmental shifts using:

- Holocene -> Late Prehistoric transitions  
- temporal stacking of proxy layers  
- changes in eco-hydrological stability  

OWL-Time ensures temporal rigor.

---

## ⚠️ Uncertainty Narratives (`uncertainty/`)

AI must document:

- proxy disagreement  
- model uncertainty  
- climate reconstruction limits  
- narrative confidence levels  

Displayed in Focus Mode as “Confidence Chips.”

---

## 🧬 Metadata & Provenance

### **STAC Metadata (`stac/`)**
Contains:

- H3 geometries  
- relevant proxy datasets  
- uncertainty & explainability metadata  
- environmental context classification  

### **DCAT Metadata (`metadata/`)**
Includes:

- dataset descriptions  
- accessibility & governance  
- FAIR+CARE alignment  
- narrative safety classification  

### **PROV-O Lineage (`provenance/`)**
Logs:

- AI activity IDs  
- datasets used (`prov:used`)  
- reasoning pipeline (`prov:wasGeneratedBy`)  
- safety filter results  
- explainability artifacts  

---

## 🧠 Focus Mode Integration

Paleoenvironment interpretations drive:

- environmental panels in Story Node v3  
- climate/hydrology overlays in Focus Mode  
- contextual explanations for settlement patterns  
- safe, non-cultural environmental narratives  

Example Focus Summary:

> **Focus Summary:**  
> AI paleoenvironment analysis shows that regions with stable hydrology and moderate climate variability align with generalized settlement patterns. Interpretations remain environmental only and culturally neutral.

---

## ⚠️ CARE & Ethical Safeguards

All outputs must:

- avoid cultural attribution  
- avoid sensitive or sacred environmental inference  
- embed uncertainty transparently  
- adhere to H3 r7+ spatial masking  
- be grounded strictly in real datasets  
- undergo FAIR+CARE + AI Governance review  

If no safe inference exists, the output must state:  
**“No safe paleoenvironment interpretation available.”**
