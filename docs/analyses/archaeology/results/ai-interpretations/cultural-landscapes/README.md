# 🤖🌾 **AI Interpretations — Cultural Landscapes**  
`docs/analyses/archaeology/results/ai-interpretations/cultural-landscapes/README.md`

**Purpose:**  
Provide **FAIR+CARE–aligned, sovereignty-respecting AI-generated interpretations** of generalized cultural landscapes within the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
These summaries synthesize environmental, hydrological, stratigraphic, geophysical, and archaeological data to describe **broad-scale cultural-landscape tendencies** — never specific sites, identities, or restricted knowledge.

</div>

---

## 📘 Overview

This directory contains AI-generated cultural-landscape interpretations that:

- describe **generalized interaction regions**  
- explain environmental affordances & constraints  
- relate hydrology, terrain, and vegetation to cultural mobility  
- summarize **non-sensitive**, broad-scale cultural dynamics  
- use **H3 r7/r8** masking for spatial privacy  
- provide **explainability overlays** (SHAP/LIME)  
- remain fully grounded in verified KFM datasets  
- follow **strict AI governance & cultural safety rules**  

These interpretations do **not** attempt:

- to assign tribal or cultural identity  
- to infer sacred geographies  
- to identify or reconstruct exact boundaries  
- to interpret ceremonial, burial, or restricted-use landscapes  

All content is filtered via automated and human FAIR+CARE review.

## 🌾 Cultural Landscape Interpretation Types

### **1️⃣ Eco-Region Interpretations (`eco-regions/`)**
AI describes generalized patterns in:

- prairie–woodland transitions  
- soil/vegetation affordances  
- terrain-linked activity potential  
- hydro-ecological stability zones  

No cultural identity or restricted knowledge is inferred.

---

### **2️⃣ Movement & Corridor Landscapes (`corridors/`)**
AI explains:

- generalized movement tendencies  
- low-cost environmental pathways  
- hydrology-linked mobility regions  
- eco-focal corridor alignments  

These are **non-deterministic** and never represent exact trails.

---

### **3️⃣ Interaction Zones (`interaction-zones/`)**
AI identifies:

- broad, non-specific interaction landscapes  
- environmental co-use zones  
- multi-community or multi-period shared-response regions  
- generalized cultural spheres (environmentally derived)  

Always **H3 generalized**, culturally-safe abstractions.

---

### **4️⃣ Hydrology-Linked Cultural Landscapes (`hydrology-linked/`)**
Summaries include:

- terrace/alluvial affordances  
- perennial stream corridor influences  
- hydroclimate stability zones  
- drought/wet cycle responses (generalized)  

---

### **5️⃣ Temporal Cultural Landscapes (`temporal/`)**
Time-aware AI interpretations using OWL-Time:

- shifting affordance regions  
- long-term environmental transitions  
- landscape evolution across cultural phases  

Never assigns cultural identity or chronologically sensitive information.

---

## 🧬 Metadata & Provenance

### **STAC Metadata (`stac/`)**
Each AI interpretation includes:

- H3-only geometry  
- SHAP/LIME explainability layers  
- proxy layers used  
- dataset cross-links  
- uncertainty + confidence metadata  
- CARE classification  

### **DCAT Metadata (`metadata/`)**
Documents:

- interpretive scope  
- environmental drivers  
- licensing & accessibility  
- narrative safety level  
- FAIR+CARE notes  

### **PROV-O Lineage (`provenance/`)**
Tracks:

- AI model version & reasoning pipeline  
- datasets used in synthesis  
- generalization parameters  
- AI safety filter logs  
- WAL checkpoints for reproducibility  

---

## 🧠 Focus Mode Integration

Cultural-landscape interpretations are used in:

- Focus Mode v3 environmental explanations  
- Story Node v3 landscape context panels  
- temporal slider narratives  
- cross-domain reasoning (eco + hydrology + artifact summaries)  

Example Focus Summary:

> **Focus Summary:**  
> AI interpretation identifies broad, environmentally favorable corridors and plains–river interface regions where generalized cultural landscapes appear to recur across periods. Spatial details are masked, and no cultural identity is inferred.

---

## ⚠️ CARE & Ethical Constraints

All interpretations must:

- use H3 r7+ spatial generalization  
- avoid restricted cultural, ceremonial, or sacred knowledge  
- avoid ethnic or cultural labeling  
- avoid assigning ownership, identity, or meaning  
- provide uncertainty statements  
- remain grounded in scientifically verified data  
- pass FAIR+CARE + AI Safety reviews  

If insufficient evidence exists → output must state **“No safe interpretation available.”**
