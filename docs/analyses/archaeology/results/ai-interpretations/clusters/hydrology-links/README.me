# 💧 Archaeology AI Interpretations — Hydrology Linkages  
### docs/analyses/archaeology/results/ai-interpretations/clusters/hydrology-links/README.md

**Purpose:**  
Provide v11.1-certified hydrology linkage interpretations derived from archaeological cluster analysis.  
This layer reveals how water availability, drainage structure, seasonal flow regimes, and floodplain dynamics  
shape archaeological distribution, occupation windows, subsistence behavior, and movement.  
All outputs are STAC-aligned, FAIR+CARE validated, Story Node v3 compatible, and Neo4j KG ingestible.

# 🧭 1. Overview

Hydrology linkage analysis identifies how archaeological clusters relate to:

- Perennial vs. ephemeral water sources  
- Stream orders and drainage density  
- Floodplain access and terrace formation  
- Springs, seeps, wetlands, and oxbows  
- Seasonal flow regimes  
- Catchment geometry and watershed boundaries  
- Riverine mobility corridors  
- Water-dependent ecological niches  

This directory contains AI-generated hydrology linkage summaries that integrate:

- Story Node v3 narrative structure  
- Focus Mode v3 reasoning rules  
- CIDOC-CRM event/place semantics  
- OWL-Time intervals for hydrological seasonality  
- GeoSPARQL-aligned geometries  
- Full PROV-O lineage

# 🌊 2. Hydrology Linkages (v11.1 Definition)

Hydrology linkages describe **how water features mediate the affordances, constraints, and  
spatiotemporal organization** of archaeological clusters.

Hydrological linkage factors assessed:

1. **Water Reliability** (perennial stream proximity, groundwater emergence)  
2. **Floodplain Dynamics** (active vs. stable floodplains, avulsion zones)  
3. **Hydro-Seasonality** (dry vs. wet season habitability)  
4. **Catchment Position** (valley floor, mid-slope, ridge adjacency)  
5. **Riverscape Mobility** (travel corridors, canoe-accessible stretches)  
6. **Aquatic Resources** (fish, mussels, waterfowl, riparian vegetation)  
7. **Terrain–Hydrology Interactions** (slope-runoff coupling, erosion risk)  
8. **Hazard Context** (flood risk, drought exposure, hydrological fragmentation)

These relationships generate:

- A narrative summary  
- An 8–12 dimension hydrology vector  
- A STAC-described asset  
- A KG-ingestible Story Node  
- A reproducible PROV-O chain  

---

# 🛠️ 3. AI Interpretation Pipeline

Hydrology-linkage interpretations use:

- Cluster geometry (H3 generalized if needed)  
- National Hydrography Dataset (NHD)  
- High-resolution DEM derivatives (slope, flow accumulation, TWI)  
- Seasonal discharge models  
- Watershed boundaries and sub-basins  
- Focus Transformer v3 hydrology module  
- SHAP environmental attribution  

Pipeline steps:

1. Extract cluster footprint  
2. Evaluate hydrological datasets  
3. Compute hydrology vector  
4. Generate narrative (Focus Mode v3)  
5. Apply CARE screening  
6. Export Story Node pseudo-JSON-LD  
7. Emit PROV-O lineage  
8. Publish STAC Item  

All outputs are deterministic (seeded) and fully reproducible.

# 🧪 4. Metadata & Standards

This directory strictly adheres to:

- **STAC 1.0** hydrology-linked Items  
- **DCAT 3.0** dataset descriptors  
- **CIDOC-CRM** for cultural heritage semantics  
- **GeoSPARQL** for feature geometry  
- **OWL-Time** for hydrological seasonality  
- **PROV-O** for lineage  
- **FAIR+CARE** for ethical, transparent data governance  

This ensures:  
- discoverability  
- long-term maintainability  
- graph-safe integration  
- ethical compliance  
- cross-domain interoperability

# 🧩 7. Example Story Node Binding (Pseudo-JSON)

(Shown as structured natural text per v11.1; non-executable and extraction-safe.)

Story Node Example:
- id: kfm:hydrology:cluster_12  
- type: story-node  
- title: Hydrology Linkage Summary — Cluster 12  
- spacetime:  
  - geometry: MultiPolygon (H3 generalized)  
  - when: start=1100-01-01, end=1400-01-01, precision=year  
- narrative:  
  - body: “Cluster 12 displays consistent association with perennial tributaries feeding the central basin...”  
- relations:  
  - rel: describes  
  - target: kfm:cluster:12

# 🔒 8. FAIR+CARE Compliance

Hydrology-linkage data is non-sensitive but must follow:

- Indigenous land masking when associated with cultural sites  
- No inference of tribal identity  
- Explicit uncertainty in hydrological reconstruction  
- Licensing inheritance from parent datasets  
- Fully transparent provenance  

All automated interpretations undergo CARE screening prior to publication.

---

# 🔧 9. Maintenance Rules

- Regenerate hydrology outputs whenever hydrological datasets or DEM derivatives update.  
- Re-run STAC validation for each update.  
- All files must pass:  
  - Markdown linting  
  - FAIR+CARE audit  
  - STAC validation  
  - Provenance schema validation  
  - Graph ingest dry-run  

No merge permitted if any check fails.
