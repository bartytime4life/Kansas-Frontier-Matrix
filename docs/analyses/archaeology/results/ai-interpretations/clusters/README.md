# 🤖📍 **AI Interpretations — Generalized Archaeological Clusters**  
`docs/analyses/archaeology/results/ai-interpretations/clusters/README.md`

**Purpose:**  
Provide a controlled, FAIR+CARE–governed registry of **AI-generated explanations of generalized archaeological clusters**, derived from H3-masked spatial distributions, KDE surfaces, environmental correlations, and cultural-landscape context in the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  

All outputs in this directory are **abstracted, non-locational**, and reviewed for cultural safety and scientific validity.

</div>

---

## 📘 Overview

These AI cluster interpretations describe **general patterns**, including:

- broad settlement tendencies  
- hydrology-linked spatial densities  
- environmental affordance gradients  
- cluster persistence across temporal intervals  
- inter-regional similarities and transitions  

They **never** describe:

- exact site coordinates  
- sensitive cultural geography  
- burial/cosmological information  
- tribal-specific or restricted heritage knowledge  

All outputs are:

- H3 r7+ generalized  
- SHAP/LIME explainability supported  
- controlled via AI narrative safety constraints  
- governed under FAIR+CARE  
- linked to PROV-O lineage  
- validated via MCP-DL reproducibility protocols

## 🔍 Cluster Interpretation Types

### **1️⃣ Late Prehistoric Clusters (`late-prehistoric/`)**
AI descriptions of:

- major generalized cluster regions  
- corridor-linked spatial densities  
- eco-hydrological associations  
- transitions toward protohistoric movement corridors  

Outputs must include:  
- uncertainty notes  
- environmental drivers  
- no cultural attribution

---

### **2️⃣ Protohistoric Clusters (`protohistoric/`)**
AI summaries that contextualize:

- interaction zones  
- movement patterns  
- generalized settlement tendencies  
- changes relative to Late Prehistoric clusters  

---

### **3️⃣ Cross-Period Cluster Comparisons (`multi-period/`)**
Includes:

- broad pattern persistence  
- environmental shifts  
- cluster expansions/contractions  
- non-ethnic, non-specific interpretations  

---

### **4️⃣ Hydrology-Linked Cluster Interpretations (`hydrology-links/`)**
AI identifies:

- connections between rivers/terraces and generalized clusters  
- eco-hydrological stability  
- long-term settlement affordance patterns  

---

### **5️⃣ Environmental Affordance Cluster Explanations (`environmental-affordances/`)**
AI discusses:

- soils, vegetation, hydrology interactions  
- terrain suitability  
- environmental constraints and opportunities  

All explanations reference actual KFM datasets only.

---

## 🧬 Metadata & Provenance

### **STAC**
Cluster interpretation STAC entries must include:

- H3 geometry only  
- links to generalized spatial layers  
- SHAP/LIME explainability artifacts  
- CARE labels  

### **DCAT**
Documents:

- dataset type  
- interpretive scope  
- distribution metadata  
- FAIR + CARE statements  

### **PROV-O**
Located in `provenance/`, recording:

- AI model version  
- reasoning pipeline activity  
- datasets used  
- explainability outputs  
- safety filters triggered  

---

## 🧠 Focus Mode Integration

Cluster interpretations feed:

- Focus Mode v3 pattern-explanation chips  
- Story Node spatial summaries  
- corridor + climate overlays  
- time-slider contextual descriptions  

Example Focus Summary:

> **Focus Summary:**  
> Generalized clusters align with stable hydrology corridors and environmentally favorable terrace systems. These patterns reflect broad landscape tendencies rather than specific site locations, and all spatial information is CARE-generalized.

---

## ⚠️ CARE & Ethical Rules

All AI cluster interpretations must:

- avoid predicting or implying exact site locations  
- never link clusters to tribal identity  
- avoid describing sacred geography  
- generalize clusters using H3 r7+  
- include uncertainty statements  
- undergo FAIR+CARE review  
- pass AI Safety Governance filters  

If evidence is insufficient →  
AI must produce **“No safe inference can be made”**.
