# 🏺 Archaeology AI Interpretations — Late Prehistoric Clusters  
### docs/analyses/archaeology/results/ai-interpretations/clusters/late-prehistoric/README.md

**Purpose:**  
Provide KFM-v11.1 Late Prehistoric cluster interpretations generated by the archaeological AI engine.  
These clusters represent cultural landscapes from roughly CE 900–1450 across Kansas, and form a  
major analytical bridge into Protohistoric and Early Contact periods.  
All interpretations comply with Story Node v3, Focus Mode v3, FAIR+CARE, STAC 1.0, DCAT 3.0,  
CIDOC-CRM, GeoSPARQL, OWL-Time, and PROV-O lineage requirements.

# 🧭 1. Overview

Late Prehistoric clusters in Kansas typically reflect:

- Village-scale sedentism or semi-sedentism  
- Agriculture intensification (maize, cucurbits, local foraging)  
- Ceramic stylistic patterns  
- River-valley adaptation  
- Interregional exchange corridors  
- Defensive landscape organization  
- Seasonal aggregation and dispersal behavior  

This directory contains:

- AI-generated Late Prehistoric narrative summaries  
- Cultural–environmental affordance vectors  
- Provenance records for reproducibility  
- STAC-described spatiotemporal Items  
- Story Node–ready pseudo-JSON-LD bindings  
- Metadata for integration into the Neo4j archaeological knowledge graph

# 🏹 2. Cultural Interpretation Model (v11.1)

Late Prehistoric clusters are analyzed using a combined **Cultural–Environmental** schema:

### Cultural Attributes  
1. Architectural patterns (lodges, pit houses, villages)  
2. Ceramic typology and stylistic lineage  
3. Lithic distribution and raw material acquisition  
4. Agricultural indicators (storage, fields, grinding implements)  
5. Social aggregation intensity  
6. Defensive features or topographic positioning  
7. Intersite connectivity networks  
8. Mortuary and ritual signals (aggregated, CARE-screened only)

### Environmental Context  
1. River valley or terrace proximity  
2. Soil productivity envelopes  
3. Hydrological stability (perennial water access)  
4. Faunal habitat zones  
5. Seasonal climate windows  
6. Mobility corridor adjacency  
7. Hazard exposure (flood, drought, wildfire)

These combined domains produce:

- A cultural–environmental affordance narrative  
- A numeric vector (~15–20 entries)  
- A Story Node binding  
- A STAC Item with spatial/temporal envelope  
- PROV-O lineage describing data → activity → agent

# 🛠️ 3. AI Interpretation Pipeline

Pipeline components used for Late Prehistoric interpretations:

- Focus Transformer v3 Cultural Model  
- Environmental Affordance Engine v11.1  
- DEM/slope/hydrology/soils rasters  
- Cultural metadata tables (village features, ceramics, features, toolkits)  
- Seasonal climatic reconstructions  
- H3-derived cluster generalization (CARE-compliant)  
- Deterministic seeded inference  
- SHAP attribution for cultural–environmental weighting  

Pipeline stages:

1. Cluster footprint extraction  
2. Cultural feature integration  
3. Environmental layer sampling  
4. Vector computation  
5. Narrative construction  
6. CARE screening + Indigenous site masking  
7. Story Node assembly (pseudo-JSON-LD)  
8. STAC Item creation  
9. PROV-O lineage export

- Social organization considerations  
- Defensive or mobility inferences  
- Temporal positioning  
- Uncertainty statement  
- CARE and masking flags  

### Affordance Vector (`*.vector.json` pseudo)
- Cultural domain scores  
- Environmental domain scores  
- Confidence intervals  
- SHAP weighting notes  

### STAC Item (`*.stac.json`)
- Geometry  
- Temporal interval  
- Assets  
- Provenance links  
- License  
- Data lineage  

### Provenance (`*.prov.json`)

# 🧩 6. Example Story Node Binding (Pseudo-JSON)

(Structured natural text only — v11.1 prohibits executable JSON in docs.)

Story Node Example:  
- id: kfm:late-prehistoric:cluster_05  
- type: story-node  
- title: Late Prehistoric Cluster Interpretation — Cluster 05  
- spacetime:  
  - geometry: Generalized MultiPolygon  
  - when: start=1000-01-01, end=1400-01-01, precision=year  
- narrative:  
  - body: “Cluster 05 exhibits characteristic Late Prehistoric settlement patterns including small aggregated villages along tributary rivers...”  
- relations:  
  - rel: describes  
  - target: kfm:cluster:05  

---

# 🔒 7. FAIR+CARE Compliance

All Late Prehistoric interpretations follow:

- Indigenous land masking  
- No tribal identity inference without confirmed evidence  
- CARE risk screening  
- Explicit uncertainty statements  
- Clear lineage and reproducibility  
- Licensing propagation from all parent datasets  
- Ethical handling of mortuary or sensitive cultural features (masked or omitted)

---

# 🔧 8. Maintenance Rules

- Regenerate interpretations if:  
  - cluster geometries change  
  - cultural datasets update  
  - environmental rasters update  
  - seasonal model parameters change  

- All outputs must pass:  
  - Markdown lint  
  - FAIR+CARE audit  
  - STAC JSON schema validation  
  - PROV-O schema validation  
  - Knowledge graph ingest dry-run  
  - Telemetry logging  

No merge is allowed if any validation fails.
