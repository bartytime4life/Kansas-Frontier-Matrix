# 🕰️🌾 **Cultural Landscapes — Temporal Landscape Results**  
`docs/analyses/archaeology/results/cultural-landscapes/temporal/README.md`

**Purpose:**  
Provide a FAIR+CARE–aligned, environmentally grounded registry of **temporal cultural-landscape results**, describing generalized landscape tendencies across archaeological time (Late Prehistoric → Protohistoric → Historic), using **OWL-Time** and strictly generalized environmental modeling.

</div>

---

## 📘 Overview

Temporal cultural-landscape results provide:

- long-term environmental change summaries  
- multi-period landscape-use tendencies  
- generalized transitions in corridor, affordance, and interaction-sphere patterns  
- time-aware environmental context blocks for Focus Mode and Story Nodes  
- uncertainty-aware narratives of landscape evolution  

They rely on:

- paleoenvironmental reconstructions  
- hydrology & terrain temporal models  
- vegetation & ecozone shifts  
- climate seasonality transitions  
- H3 r7+ generalized settlement-pattern summaries  

They **never** include:

- specific cultural chronologies  
- tribal/historic identity attribution  
- site-level temporal analysis  
- sacred or restricted time-linked knowledge

## ⏳ Temporal Result Categories

### **1️⃣ Temporal Intervals (`intervals/`)**
Contain OWL-Time aligned intervals describing:

- generalized environmental windows  
- hydrology-stable vs hydrology-volatile periods  
- ecozone transition intervals  
- climate variability periods  

No cultural periodization is inferred.

---

### **2️⃣ Environmental Transitions (`transitions/`)**
Represent:

- hydrology changes  
- vegetation/ecozone shifts  
- climate transitions  
- combined multi-factor change envelopes  

All generalized, no site-linked data.

---

### **3️⃣ Multi-Period Temporal Landscapes (`multi-period/`)**
Include:

- cross-period landscape comparisons  
- long-term environmental stability zones  
- generalized mobility/affordance persistence  

No cultural continuity or identity claims.

---

### **4️⃣ Paleoenvironment Temporal Links (`paleoenvironment-links/`)**
Summaries connecting:

- drought/wet cycles to environment-only changes  
- seasonal variability  
- vegetation–hydrology combined shifts  

Never tied to cultural groups.

---

### **5️⃣ Temporal Settlement Tendencies (`settlement-patterns/`)**
Include:

- broad H3-based settlement trends  
- environmental correlation changes over time  
- non-predictive, non-cultural interpretations  

---

## ⚠️ Temporal Uncertainty (`uncertainty/`)
Stores:

- uncertainty intervals  
- proxy disagreement  
- environmental reconstruction variance  
- model agreement metrics  

Displayed in Focus Mode as **Temporal Confidence Chips**.

---

## 🧬 Metadata & Provenance

### **STAC (`stac/`)**  
Temporal STAC Items include:

- OWL-Time intervals  
- H3 generalized geometry  
- environmental driver metadata  
- uncertainty descriptors  
- lineage references  

### **DCAT (`metadata/`)**  
Contains:

- dataset descriptions  
- time-based classification  
- FAIR+CARE governance  
- distribution & licensing  

### **PROV-O (`provenance/`)**
Documents:

- environmental/landscape datasets used  
- temporal modeling operations  
- generalization & masking steps  
- uncertainty propagation  
- WAL → Retry → Lineage tracking  

---

## 🧠 Focus Mode Integration

Temporal landscape datasets power:

- time-sliced map overlays  
- contextual Story Node environmental backdrops  
- generalized landscape-evolution explanations  
- non-speculative, environmental-only narratives  

Example Focus Summary:

> **Focus Summary:**  
> Temporal landscape models indicate broad eco-hydrological trends across Kansas, showing long-term environmental shifts relevant to generalized cultural-landscape interpretation. All outputs are generalized and CARE-reviewed.

---

## 🛡️ CARE & Ethical Requirements

Temporal landscape outputs must:

- avoid cultural or tribal identity inference  
- avoid precise temporal claims  
- avoid restricted temporal-geographic information  
- disclose uncertainty clearly  
- follow H3 r7+ generalization  
- pass FAIR+CARE Council review  

If unsafe temporal interpretations arise → dataset must be masked or excluded.
