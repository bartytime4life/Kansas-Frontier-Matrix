# 📓🌾 **Cultural Landscape Analysis Notebooks — Results Index**  
`docs/analyses/archaeology/results/notebooks/cultural-landscapes/README.md`

**Purpose:**  
Provide a centralized, FAIR+CARE-aligned index for all **cultural landscape analytical notebooks** used to generate interaction spheres, corridors, ecological affordance models, temporal landscape sequences, and composite environmental narratives within the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
These notebooks contain intermediate calculations, QC diagnostics, GIS-model transforms, environmental predictors, and uncertainty evaluations—**never cultural boundaries, identities, or restricted knowledge.**

</div>

---

## 📘 Overview

Cultural landscape notebooks support:

- environmental interaction-sphere derivation  
- corridor modeling diagnostics  
- hydrology/terrain/vegetation/soil covariate computation  
- temporal landscape evolution modeling (OWL-Time compliant)  
- composite multi-driver surface generation  
- H3 r7+ generalization enforcement  
- multi-proxy uncertainty evaluation  
- provenance-export (PROV-O bundles)  
- STAC/DCAT-ready metadata preparation  
- sovereignty & CARE safety checks prior to publishing results  

All notebooks must avoid:

- inferring cultural territories  
- mapping restricted landscapes  
- unreviewed interpretation of culturally sensitive places  
- disallowed geospatial precision (< H3 r7)

## 🧪 Notebook Categories

### **1️⃣ Interaction Sphere Notebooks (`interaction-spheres/`)**
Contain:

- environmental similarity clustering  
- eco-hydrological region extraction  
- generalized sphere envelope construction  
- H3 r7+ spatial generalization routines  

Never cultural-identity spheres.

---

### **2️⃣ Corridor Modeling Notebooks (`corridors/`)**
Produce:

- terrain cost-distance grids  
- hydrology flow-affordance models  
- climate/seasonality movement-affordance overlays  
- composite corridor envelopes  

Environmental-only.

---

### **3️⃣ Ecological Affordance Notebooks (`ecological-affordances/`)**
Include:

- soil/vegetation/climate/ecozone suitability grids  
- multi-proxy environmental stability estimations  
- environmental resilience indicators  

No cultural-attribution modeling.

---

### **4️⃣ Temporal Landscape Notebooks (`temporal/`)**
Generate:

- long-term environmental transition models  
- multi-period affordance surfaces  
- environmental “stability windows”  
- uncertainty-weighted temporal envelopes  

Not cultural timelines.

---

### **5️⃣ Composite Landscape Notebooks (`composite/`)**
Integrate:

- corridors  
- spheres  
- settlement generalizations  
- ecological surfaces  
- climate/hydrology constraints  

Outputs remain purely environmental.

---

### **6️⃣ Environmental Drivers (`environmental-drivers/`)**
Prepare:

- hydrology networks  
- terrain derivatives  
- vegetation & biomass surfaces  
- soil chemistry & texture drivers  
- climate/seasonal predictors  

These feed upstream landscape models.

---

### **7️⃣ Uncertainty Notebooks (`uncertainty/`)**
Document:

- proxy disagreement  
- model variance  
- environmental ambiguity  
- temporal uncertainty  
- error surfaces exported for Focus Mode chips  

---

### **8️⃣ Cultural Safety & QA Notebooks (`qa/`)**
Perform:

- H3 masking verification  
- sovereignty-generalization checks  
- CARE risk assessment  
- STAC/DCAT metadata integrity  
- cross-driver consistency tests  
- redaction review workflows  

---

## 🧬 Metadata & Provenance Integration

Every notebook must export:

- **PROV-O bundles**  
- **STAC-ready metadata blocks**  
- **DCAT JSON-LD descriptors**  
- **uncertainty metrics**  
- **generalization + redaction logs**  
- model parameter hashes (for reproducibility)

These feed the final results in:

- `cultural-landscapes/*/metadata/`  
- `cultural-landscapes/*/provenance/`  
- `cultural-landscapes/*/stac/`

---

## 🧠 Focus Mode Integration

Cultural landscape notebooks contribute:

- environmental context blocks  
- multi-period environmental summaries  
- safe narrative overlays  
- uncertainty chips reflecting proxy disagreement  
- Story Node scaffolding (non-cultural, environmental-only)

Example Focus Summary:

> **Focus Summary:**  
> Cultural landscape notebooks provide environmental-only modeling foundations—corridors, interaction spheres, and ecological surfaces—generalized to protect sovereignty and align with FAIR+CARE.

---

## 🛡 CARE & Ethical Requirements

All notebooks:

- must avoid ANY cultural-boundary inference  
- must apply H3 r7+ masking before export  
- must document masking + redaction logic  
- must exclude restricted landscapes  
- must provide sovereignty notes in metadata  
- must undergo FAIR+CARE review before result publication  

Notebooks failing cultural-safety checks cannot be released.
