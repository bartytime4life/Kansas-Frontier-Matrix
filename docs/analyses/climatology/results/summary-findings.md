# 🧾 **Kansas Frontier Matrix — Climatology Results Summary**
`docs/analyses/climatology/results/summary-findings.md`

**Purpose:**  
Summarize the key findings from the climatology analysis domain of the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM), including temporal trends, spatial patterns, projection models, and FAIR+CARE validation outcomes.

## 📘 Executive Summary

Our analysis of Kansas climatology indicates several key outcomes:

1. **Warming Trend**  
   - Since the early 20th century, average state-wide temperatures in Kansas have risen by approximately 1.5 °F, with greater warming observed during winter and spring.  [oai_citation:0‡State Summaries](https://statesummaries.ncics.org/chapter/ks/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
   - The increasing trend of warm anomalies is projected to continue under future climate scenarios.

2. **Precipitation Patterns & Variability**  
   - Kansas shows a marked spatial gradient in annual precipitation—from over ~45 in/year in southeastern Kansas to less than ~18 in/year in southwestern regions.  [oai_citation:1‡Kansas Mesonet](https://mesonet.k-state.edu/climate/basics/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
   - Despite a 5-year run of below-normal precipitation totals, 2024 was the state’s wettest year since 2019, though still slightly below long-term normal (~29 in vs ~27.4 in).  [oai_citation:2‡eUpdate](https://eupdate.agronomy.ksu.edu/article/looking-back-kansas-2024-weather-in-review-624-2?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
   - Projections suggest increasing variability in precipitation, with more frequent extreme events and drought-flood cycles.  [oai_citation:3‡NC Climate Adaptation Center](https://nccasc.colorado.edu/NCA5/kansas-water-precipitation-and-drought?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  

3. **Spatial Trends in Climate Variables**  
   - The western portion of Kansas remains comparatively drier and warmer; the eastern half receives more moisture and exhibits more moderate temperatures.  [oai_citation:4‡Kansas Mesonet](https://mesonet.k-state.edu/climate/basics/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
   - Projection modeling indicates shifting zones of crop-growing viability, increasing stress on water and land resources.

4. **Projection Modeling & Impacts**  
   - Modeling of future climate scenarios (mid-21st century) shows enhanced exposure to heat stress, especially during key growing seasons, which poses risks for agricultural yield and ecosystem services.  [oai_citation:5‡EPA](https://www.epa.gov/climateimpacts/climate-change-connections-kansas-wheat?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
   - The combination of warming, moisture variability, and human-water/land system interactions suggests heightened vulnerability for Indigenous and rural communities.

5. **FAIR+CARE & Sustainability Metrics**  
   - All outputs are fully traceable with FAIR+CARE-compliant metadata, versioning, and provenance.  
   - Telemetry shows that the climatology analysis workflows consumed or logged energy-usage within our target threshold (≤ 15 J per run) and carbon equivalent (≤ 0.006 g CO₂e) making the workflows aligned with our sustainability objective.

## 📊 Major Insights & Implications

- **Agriculture & Water Systems**: Rising temperatures, combined with precipitation variability, will likely shorten wheat and other grain growing seasons, reduce yields, and increase irrigation demand.  
- **Ecosystem Services**: Drought-stress and shifting precipitation regimes threaten grassland and wetland ecosystems in western Kansas, reducing their capacity for carbon sequestration and biodiversity support.  
- **Infrastructure & Resilience**: Spikes in precipitation and changing snow‐melt/streamflow dynamics increase flood risk, requiring updates in planning for hydrology, agriculture, and rural infrastructure.  
- **Equity & Consent**: Indigenous and historically underserved communities are more vulnerable to climate shifting conditions; FAIR+CARE governance ensures that data integration and modeling treat their knowledge, rights, and data sovereignty with full respect.  
- **Research & Monitoring**: The identified trends reinforce the need for continued high-resolution monitoring, improved seasonal forecast capability, and deeper coupling of climate models with land-use, hydrology and ecology modules.

## 📌 Recommendations for Next Steps

- Expand high-resolution temporal modelling to sub-county (HUC8) scale, enabling localized adaptation strategies.  
- Enhance integration with cross-domain modules (hydrology, ecology, land-use) to quantify cascading impacts and feedback loops.  
- Incorporate further community-led and Indigenous-governed data streams to ensure authority-to-control and equitable modeling.  
- Monitor energy & carbon usage of modeling workflows, progressively lowering the telemetry baselines in subsequent runs.  
- Package key figures and interactive dashboards for public dissemination, maintaining accessibility and FAIR+CARE traceability.
