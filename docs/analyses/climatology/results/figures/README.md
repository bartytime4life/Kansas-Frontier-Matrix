# 📷 **Kansas Frontier Matrix — Climatology Figures & Visual Outputs**
`docs/analyses/climatology/results/figures/README.md`

**Purpose:**  
Provide a structured index and explanation of all visual-outputs (maps, charts, animations) produced by the climatology domain of the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM). Each visual is linked to its underlying dataset, method, and validation metric, maintaining full **FAIR+CARE**, **MCP-DL v6.3**, and **ISO/19115** compliance.

## 📖 Overview

The **Figures** directory houses high-fidelity visualizations generated from climatology analyses: temperature anomaly maps, precipitation change graphs, trend animations, projection slices, etc.  
Each visualization is accompanied by a descriptive caption, file format, resolution, provenance link (to methods + dataset), and version metadata.  
This README acts as an entry point for navigating the visual assets, understanding their context, and tracing their origin.
