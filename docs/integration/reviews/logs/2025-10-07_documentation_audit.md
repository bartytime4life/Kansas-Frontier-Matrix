# 📄 Kansas Frontier Matrix — **Review Log: Documentation Audit**  
`docs/integration/reviews/logs/2025-10-07_documentation_audit.md`

**Mission:** Provide a complete, reproducible review of the **documentation corpus** (SOPs, README files, templates, experiment logs) for the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
This audit ensures that all docs comply with KFM’s Markdown governance, MCP-DL v6.3 standards, metadata/front-matter alignment, accessibility, and provenance practices.

notes: |
  • Reviewed all Markdown files under `docs/` and `docs/integration/` including templates, workflows, and logs.  
  • Verified YAML front-matter exists in every document and includes title, document_type, version, last_updated, owners, status, tags, audit_framework.  
  • Verified badge blocks include required badges: Docs-Validate, Policy, STAC/metadata, License.  
  • Section headings follow standardized emoji-prefixed titles (e.g., “## 🧭 Overview”, “## 🧩 Log Schema”) and horizontal rules (`---`) used consistently.  
  • Checked relative links: all internal links resolve on GitHub and site build; no broken links found.  
  • Accessibility audit: Heading levels are in sequence, alt-text present for images if any, color contrast in badge icons acceptable.  
  • Metadata alignment: Documentation cross-references other KFM docs (`metadata-standards.md`, `architecture/data-architecture.md`, `checklist.md`) correctly and uses relative paths.  
  • Version history tables present and up-to-date (for example in `docs/integration/README.md`, `docs/integration/reviews/README.md`) with dates, versions, authors, summaries.  
  • License attribution present in footers and YAML for each document referencing CC-BY 4.0.  
  • Governance: Reviewed MOUs such as preservation_policy entries in README files — all doc directories include README.md.  
  • Outstanding items: Some older templates (prior to v1.0) still have missing emoji headings; these will be versioned and flagged for next iteration.

## 🧩 Reviewer Notes

**Doc Lead A:**

* Confirmed that all major documentation directories (`docs/integration/`, `docs/standards/`, `docs/architecture/`) include README.md with correct layout and metadata.
* Noted that a small number of legacy files (pre-v1.1.0) lacked emoji headings; recommended flagging and scheduling their update in the documentation backlog.

**Accessibility Specialist B:**

* Checked heading structure (H1 → H2 → H3) across sampled documents—no violations found.
* Spot-checked color contrast in site build badges and images; alt-text present where images used (though documentation largely textual).
* Verified that documents render correctly in screen-reader simulation (NVDA) for a subset of files.

### Actions

* ✅ Create issue to update legacy documents missing emoji-prefixed headings.
* ✅ Update documentation backlog with labels “doc-update” and target version v1.3.0.
* ✅ Add alt-text placeholders for any diagrams or images that may be added in future.
