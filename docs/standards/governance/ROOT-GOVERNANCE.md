## üìö Overview

The **Root Governance Charter** is the primary legal and procedural document defining how **KFM governance** operates.  
It outlines the responsibilities of the **FAIR+CARE Governance Council**, data ethics policies,  
provenance tracking standards, and the integration of governance within CI/CD pipelines.

The Root Governance Framework ensures that all organizational and technical decisions:
- Are **reproducible and auditable** via the governance ledger.  
- Uphold **FAIR+CARE** ethical data and AI principles.  
- Maintain alignment with **MCP-DL v6.4.3** and ISO governance standards.  
- Protect the interests of communities and data contributors through **open ethics review**.
