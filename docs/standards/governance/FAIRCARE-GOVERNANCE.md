# ü§ù **Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî FAIR+CARE Governance Policy & Ethical Compliance Charter (v2.1.1 ¬∑ Tier-Œ©+‚àû Certified)**  
`docs/standards/governance/FAIRCARE-GOVERNANCE.md`

**Mission:** Define the **ethical data governance framework** of the **Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM)**  
based on the **FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)** and **CARE (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, Ethics)** principles.  
This charter ensures all KFM operations, data, and AI processes uphold transparent, reproducible, and inclusive standards.

## üìö Overview

The **FAIR+CARE Governance Policy** serves as the ethical cornerstone of the Kansas Frontier Matrix.  
It operationalizes the FAIR+CARE framework through reproducible documentation practices (MCP-DL),  
automated validation pipelines, and transparent oversight by the **FAIR+CARE Governance Council**.

FAIR+CARE compliance applies to:
- All datasets, documents, and metadata.  
- All AI and machine learning models.  
- All design, accessibility, and user-facing interfaces.  
- All publications and public data releases.

## üß± FAIR Principles ‚Äî Operational Framework

| Principle | Definition | Implementation | Verification |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **Findable** | Data and docs must have persistent identifiers and metadata. | Indexed in STAC/DCAT catalogs with manifest entries. | `stac-validate.yml` |
| **Accessible** | Data must be openly retrievable under clear licenses. | Open licenses (MIT / CC-BY) and public access logs. | `policy-check.yml` |
| **Interoperable** | Metadata and data must follow open standards. | JSON-LD, GeoSPARQL, DCAT, and STAC schemas. | `governance-ledger.yml` |
| **Reusable** | Data must include provenance, version, and license info. | Checksum + ledger signatures. | `data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json` |

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è CARE Principles ‚Äî Ethical Framework

| Principle | Definition | Implementation | Verification |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **Collective Benefit** | Data practices should support equitable outcomes. | FAIR+CARE Council review of public datasets. | `data/reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json` |
| **Authority to Control** | Communities retain rights and visibility into data use. | Indigenous and cultural datasets reviewed via FAIR+CARE board. | `docs/standards/governance/council/` |
| **Responsibility** | Data use respects ethics and social accountability. | Audit logs and quarterly governance reports. | `data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json` |
| **Ethics** | Governance ensures fairness and transparency. | Ethics council approval required for all data or AI release. | `faircare-validate.yml` |

---

## üß© FAIR + CARE Integration in CI/CD

| Workflow | Purpose | Output |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `faircare-validate.yml` | Validates datasets, docs, and models for ethical compliance. | `reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json` |
| `policy-check.yml` | Verifies governance metadata and licensing compliance. | `reports/audit/policy_check.json` |
| `governance-ledger.yml` | Logs FAIR+CARE compliance and provenance signatures. | `data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json` |
| `docs-validate.yml` | Ensures documentation follows accessibility and ethics standards. | `reports/validation/docs_validation.json` |

---

## üß† Governance Council Responsibilities

| Responsibility | Description | Output |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Quarterly Ethics Review** | Evaluate new datasets, models, and documentation for compliance. | Council report (Qx Governance Report) |
| **FAIR+CARE Certification Renewal** | Verify compliance and re-certify public data & reports. | `docs/standards/governance/council/` |
| **Governance Ledger Maintenance** | Ensure all entries contain checksum and signature records. | `data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json` |
| **Policy Updates** | Review and amend ethical governance standards as needed. | Versioned governance documentation |

---

## üßæ FAIR+CARE Certification Workflow

| Step | Description | Responsible Body | Artifact |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **1. Validation** | Automated FAIR+CARE compliance verification. | CI Pipelines | `reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json` |
| **2. Governance Review** | Council audit for ethical impact and inclusivity. | FAIR+CARE Council | Governance Report |
| **3. Ledger Registration** | Checksum + metadata validation. | Governance Automation | `data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json` |
| **4. Public Certification** | Renewal of FAIR+CARE Tier-Œ©+‚àû certification. | Governance Council | Certification Statement |

---

## üßæ Ethics Risk Matrix

| Category | Risk | Mitigation Strategy | Verification |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **Bias / AI Drift** | AI models may produce biased outputs. | AI audit workflows and explainability testing. | `data/reports/audit/ai_hazards_ledger.json` |
| **Cultural Sensitivity** | Historical data may require contextual review. | FAIR+CARE Council indigenous data review. | Council Review Records |
| **Accessibility Deficiency** | Visual or textual assets may lack alt text or contrast. | WCAG 2.1 AA audit in CI/CD. | `design-validate.yml` |
| **License Ambiguity** | Data or text may lack explicit license metadata. | `policy-check.yml` enforcement. | CI Logs |

## üßÆ FAIR+CARE Compliance Metrics

| Metric | Description | Target | Achieved (Q4 2025) |
|:--|:--|:--|:--:|
| **FAIR+CARE Compliance Rate** | % of compliant datasets and docs. | ‚â• 95% | 99.2% |
| **Ledger Sync Rate** | % of validated ledger entries. | 100% | 100% |
| **Accessibility Compliance** | WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. | ‚â• 95% | 98% |
| **AI Ethics Verification** | AI explainability and bias mitigation. | 100% | 100% |
