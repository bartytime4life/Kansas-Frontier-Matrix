# ‚öñÔ∏è **Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî Governance Standards & Ethical Framework (v2.1.1 ¬∑ Tier-Œ©+‚àû Certified)**  
`docs/standards/governance/README.md`

**Mission:** Define the **ethical, procedural, and technical governance standards** for the  
**Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM)** ‚Äî ensuring transparent, FAIR+CARE-aligned, and audit-verifiable decision-making  
across data, AI, design, and documentation domains.

## üìö Overview

The **Governance Standards** define the foundation of **accountability, provenance, and ethical decision-making**  
in the Kansas Frontier Matrix. This framework establishes how all systems ‚Äî from ETL pipelines to AI models ‚Äî  
must comply with the FAIR+CARE principles, documentation reproducibility (MCP-DL), and open governance verification.

These standards integrate:
- FAIR+CARE ethics and data responsibility  
- MCP-DL reproducibility documentation  
- SLSA provenance verification and SBOM compliance  
- Governance ledger traceability across CI/CD pipelines
