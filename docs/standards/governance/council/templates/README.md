## üìö Overview

The **Governance Council Templates** define the structure and metadata requirements for all  
FAIR+CARE governance reporting, meeting documentation, and compliance summaries.  

Each report template includes:
- FAIR+CARE metadata schema  
- Ledger integration fields (checksum + provenance entry)  
- Validation rules enforced by `policy-check.yml`  
- Accessibility and documentation alignment (WCAG + MCP-DL)
