# 🧾 **Generalization Validation Error Logs Index**  
`docs/standards/data-generalization/validation/reports/error_logs/README.md`

**Purpose:**  
Serve as the central index for **raw error logs** generated during generalization audits, including spatial, temporal, and CARE-related validation errors.  
These logs assist developers, auditors, and FAIR+CARE Council reviewers in diagnosing failures related to sensitive dataset generalization and compliance.

## 📘 Overview

This directory stores **stderr and stdout diagnostic logs** generated by CI/CD workflows responsible for validating generalization tasks applied to sensitive datasets.

These logs capture:
- Spatial generalization logic failures  
- Temporal masking errors  
- CARE metadata or sovereignty compliance violations  
- Schema mismatches  
- Asset loading or parsing errors  
- Incomplete or malformed generalization bundles  

Error logs are retained for **audit reproducibility**, **Council review**, and **release diagnostics**.

All results feed into:
```
releases/v10.2.0/focus-telemetry.json
reports/audit/governance-ledger.json
```

## 🧩 Log Types

### 1️⃣ Spatial Generalization Error Logs
Includes failures related to:
- Rounding thresholds not met  
- Invalid or unmasked coordinates  
- Leakage of sacred or restricted site coordinates  
- Invalid CRS or geometry structures

Example snippet:
```text
[ERROR] dataset_id=kfm-site-188
Expected generalization: ≥1000m — found precision=124m
Coordinate masking FAILED.
```

---

### 2️⃣ Temporal Generalization Error Logs
Captures:
- Temporal windows smaller than required  
- Specific restricted dates not masked  
- Incorrect or malformed date formats

Example snippet:
```text
[WARN] dataset_id=kfm-ceremony-009
Temporal window too narrow: 2 years (min: 20 years)
```

---

### 3️⃣ CARE Metadata Error Logs
Includes:
- Missing reviewer  
- Missing cultural authority  
- Missing CARE status  
- CARE restrictions violated

Example snippet:
```text
[ERROR] Missing CARE authority: authority_to_control not provided.
CARE-compliant release BLOCKED.
```

---

### 4️⃣ Bundle-Level Validation Errors
Audit failures involving combined spatial + temporal + CARE generalization.

Example snippet:
```text
[ERROR] bundle_id=kfm-bundle-12
Spatial: passed
Temporal: passed
CARE: FAILED — missing sovereignty approval
```

---

## 🧮 Telemetry Integration

Every log entry corresponds to a telemetry event containing:
- `event_type`: `"generalization_error"`  
- `severity`: `"warn" | "error" | "critical"`  
- `energy_wh` consumed during validation  
- `duration_sec`  
- `affected_dataset_ids`

These metrics populate:
```
releases/v10.2.0/focus-telemetry.json
```

---

## ⚖️ Governance Workflow Integration

Error logs are reviewed by:
- FAIR+CARE Council  
- Technical Standards Committee  
- Cultural Stewardship Representatives  
- KFM Sustainability Reviewers  

Governance outcomes are recorded in:
```
reports/audit/governance-ledger.json
```
