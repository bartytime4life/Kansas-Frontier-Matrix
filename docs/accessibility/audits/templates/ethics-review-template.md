## 📘 Overview

This template ensures every accessibility audit includes an **ethical layer of review** that evaluates *not just functional accessibility*, but also *cultural sensitivity, emotional safety, and equity of representation*.  
The review complements WCAG 2.1 AA validation by assessing human and social implications in alignment with **FAIR+CARE**, **UNESCO AI Ethics**, and **ISO 9241-210**.

Use this Markdown template to document **narrative tone**, **AI content inclusivity**, **cultural representations**, and **visual or linguistic ethics** found during each release cycle.
