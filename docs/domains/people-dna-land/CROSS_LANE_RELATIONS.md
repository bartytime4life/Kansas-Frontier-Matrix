# Cross-Lane Relations — People / Genealogy / DNA / Land Domain

> The formal edge specification for how People/DNA/Land connects to adjacent KFM lanes: which edges this domain **owns**, which it merely **consumes**, the direction and relation type of each, and the constraint every edge must preserve. The governing rule: **every cross-lane relation must preserve ownership, source role, sensitivity, and `EvidenceBundle` support** — and living-person and DNA fields **fail closed** across every boundary.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **A cross-lane edge is never a privacy bypass.** Adjacent lanes provide *context*; they do not relax this domain’s controls. Living-person fields fail closed at every join; private person↔parcel joins are denied by default; DNA-derived material never crosses a lane boundary to a public surface. If a cross-lane relation appears to *require* relaxing these controls, that requirement triggers an ADR — never a relaxation. <sup>[DOM-PEOPLE] [Atlas §16.F]</sup>

## 1. Scope

**CONFIRMED doctrine / PROPOSED implementation.** This document specifies the cross-lane edges of the People/DNA/Land domain — the relations it has with Settlements/Infrastructure, Roads/Rail, Archaeology, Agriculture, and Frontier Matrix. It draws on two CONFIRMED corpus sources that must be read together:

- **Atlas §16.F** — the People/DNA/Land domain’s own per-domain relation list (the authoritative full edge list).
- **Atlas §24.4** — the cross-lane **edge-ownership lattice**, which assigns each edge to exactly one owning lane.

Where the §24.4 lattice and the §16.F per-domain list diverge, **§16.F (v1.0) governs** and the divergence is filed as a conflict, per the corpus completeness note. <sup>[Atlas §16.F, §24.4]</sup>

Out of scope: the intra-domain object model (see `ARCHITECTURE.md`); the governed-API surface (see `API_CONTRACTS.md`); chain-of-title internals (see `CHAIN_OF_TITLE_NOTES.md`); consent mechanics (see `CONSENT_MODEL.md`).

## 2. The universal edge constraint

Every cross-lane relation in this domain — owned or consumed, inbound or outbound — MUST preserve **all four** of:

1. **Ownership** — the edge belongs to exactly one lane; the non-owning lane does not redefine it.
1. **Source role** — the canonical role (`observed`, `administrative`, `modeled`, etc.; §24.1) is carried across the join and never upgraded.
1. **Sensitivity** — the stricter of the two lanes’ tiers applies; living-person and DNA fields fail closed.
1. **`EvidenceBundle` support** — the relation resolves to evidence; an unresolvable cross-lane claim ABSTAINs.

> [!CAUTION]
> This is the single rule repeated verbatim across the entire Atlas §16.F table: *“relation must preserve ownership, source role, sensitivity, and EvidenceBundle support.”* It is not advisory. A join that drops any of the four is a release-blocking violation. <sup>[Atlas §16.F]</sup>

## 3. Edge ownership: owner vs consumer

The most important distinction in this document, and the one most easily blurred: **an edge is owned by exactly one lane.** The §24.4 lattice phrases every edge as “Owner → consumes from owner → relation,” meaning the owner defines the edge and other lanes *consume* it under the owner’s constraint.

For People/DNA/Land this produces two classes:

- **Edges this domain OWNS** (§24.4.14): this domain defines the relation and its constraint. Four edges: → Settlements, → Frontier Matrix, → Archaeology, → Agriculture.
- **Edges where this domain is the CONSUMER**: another lane owns the edge; this domain consumes it under *that* lane’s constraint. Notably Settlements-owned (settlement identity bounds residence), Archaeology-owned (cultural affiliation), and Frontier-owned (public-land context).

> [!NOTE]
> Some pairs have edges in **both** directions, owned by **different** lanes — the residence relation between People and Settlements is the clearest case (§7). This is not a contradiction: People owns “residence events anchor settlement membership,” and Settlements owns “settlement identity bounds residence and ownership context.” Two distinct, complementary edges. <sup>[Atlas §24.4.12, §24.4.14]</sup>

## 5. Edges this domain OWNS

CONFIRMED (Atlas §24.4.14). This domain defines these four edges and their constraints.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> On the Frontier Matrix edge, the flow is **one-way and aggregate**: this domain *feeds* aggregated population observations into matrix cells; matrix cells are analytical releases with their own evidence and rollback, and they **do not** edit person assertions back. Individual person/DNA/title assertions never become matrix cells. <sup>[Atlas §24.4.14, §24.4.15]</sup>

## 6. Edges where this domain is the CONSUMER

CONFIRMED. Another lane owns the edge; this domain consumes it under that lane’s constraint. This domain does **not** redefine these edges.

|Owning lane                        |Relation (owner’s definition)                                                                                    |Constraint the owner enforces                                                         |Citation               |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
|**Settlements / Infrastructure**   |Settlement identity (Township, GhostTown, Townsite, Reservation Community) bounds residence and ownership context|Settlement identity is settlement-owned; this domain references it, never redefines it|[Atlas §24.4.12]       |
|**Archaeology / Cultural Heritage**|Cultural affiliations cited with rights, sovereignty, and steward review                                         |Exact archaeological site coordinates denied; affiliation use is steward-gated        |[Atlas §24.4.13]       |
|**Frontier Matrix**                |Public-land and land-office context (Frontier owns `Land Office Record`, `Public Land Record`)                   |Provided **without living/DNA/title leakage** (§17.F)                                 |[Atlas §17.F, §24.4.15]|
|**Roads / Rail / Trade**           |Migration, access, movement context                                                                              |Movement context only; never implies real-time movement of living persons             |[Atlas §16.F]          |


> [!NOTE]
> **The Roads/Rail edge is People-cited, not Roads-owned.** Atlas §16.F lists People→Roads/Rail (migration/access/movement), but the Roads-owned edge lattice (§24.4.11) assigns Roads’ owned edges to Settlements, Frontier, and Archaeology — **not** an explicitly Roads-owned edge back to People. So this domain cites Roads/Rail corridors as migration context; the relation lives in this domain’s §16.F list. This asymmetry is flagged as OQ-XLANE-02. <sup>[Atlas §16.F, §24.4.11]</sup>

## 7. The residence edge: dual ownership

The People↔Settlements residence relation is the clearest example of **two distinct edges, owned by two different lanes** — and getting it right matters because residence is the most common cross-lane join in the domain.

|Edge                |Owner                         |Definition                                                  |Constraint                             |
|--------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
|People → Settlements|**People/DNA/Land** (§24.4.14)|“Residence events anchor settlement membership”             |Living-person fields fail closed       |
|Settlements → People|**Settlements** (§24.4.12)    |“Settlement identity bounds residence and ownership context”|Settlement identity is settlement-owned|

Read together: a `Residence Event` (owned here) references a settlement entity (owned there) by opaque id. This domain says *which person resided where, when*; Settlements says *what that place is*. Neither lane writes into the other; both edges carry the §2 constraint; the living-person fail-closed rule applies on this domain’s side regardless of direction.

> [!CAUTION]
> Do not collapse these into one edge or let one lane define both. A `Residence Event` that embedded settlement identity, or a settlement record that embedded living-person residence at exact precision, would be a boundary violation. The join is by reference, gated by sensitivity. <sup>[Atlas §24.4.12, §24.4.14]</sup>

## 8. Citing-domain sensitivity defaults

CONFIRMED (Atlas §24.14 object-family × domain matrix). When another lane cites this domain’s objects, the sensitivity default that travels with the object is fixed:

|Object cited across a lane          |Citing lanes                     |Sensitivity default (CONFIRMED)                                |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
|`Person Assertion` / `NameAssertion`|Settlements, Frontier Matrix     |**T1 / T2** (living-person fields **denied**); **aggregate T0**|
|`DNA Match Evidence` / `DNASegment` |(none — restricted lane)         |**T4** — never crosses to a public surface                     |
|`Land Ownership Assertion`          |Agriculture, Frontier (aggregate)|T1/T2 historic; private person↔parcel **denied**               |
|`Parcel Version` geometry           |Agriculture, Settlements         |`modeled`; never a title boundary                              |


> [!IMPORTANT]
> The rule is **the stricter tier wins**. A `Person Assertion` cited by Settlements does not become more public by virtue of the join — living-person fields stay denied, and only aggregate (T0) or historic non-living (T1/T2) content crosses. The citing lane inherits this domain’s restriction; it cannot loosen it. <sup>[Atlas §24.14]</sup>

## 9. Forbidden cross-lane behaviors

These are release-blocking violations. Non-negotiable without an ADR. <sup>[Atlas §16.F, §24.9.2]</sup>

|# |Forbidden                                                                                |Why                                                                  |
|--|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
|1 |A cross-lane join that exposes a living-person field                                     |Living-person fails closed across every boundary.                    |
|2 |A private person↔parcel join on a public surface                                         |Denied by default (§24.4.14).                                        |
|3 |DNA-derived material crossing a lane boundary to a public surface                        |DNA is a restricted lane; never crosses.                             |
|4 |This domain redefining an edge another lane owns (e.g., re-asserting settlement identity)|Edge ownership is singular (§24.4).                                  |
|5 |Frontier Matrix cells flowing back to edit person assertions                             |The Frontier feed is one-way aggregate (§24.4.14/15).                |
|6 |Exact archaeological site coordinates surfaced via a People/Land join                    |Site coords denied; Archaeology owns the affiliation edge (§24.4.13).|
|7 |Source-role upgrade across a join (e.g., assessor `administrative` → title `authority`)  |Source role fixed at admission (§24.1).                              |
|8 |A cross-lane claim with no resolvable `EvidenceBundle`                                   |Cite-or-abstain.                                                     |
|9 |Loosening this domain’s sensitivity tier by routing through a citing lane                |Stricter tier wins (§24.14).                                         |
|10|Settlement identity embedded in a `Residence Event` (or vice versa)                      |Join by reference only (§7).                                         |

## 10. Governed AI across lanes

CONFIRMED doctrine (Atlas §16.L; GAI). AI may traverse cross-lane edges only over **released** material, under the stricter tier, with finite outcomes `ANSWER` / `ABSTAIN` / `DENY` / `ERROR`.

## 11. Validators and fixtures

PROPOSED; homes use the **whole-domain** `people-dna-land` segment per §12. Cross-lane tests are the highest-value negative tests in the domain because joins are inference-risk multipliers (Atlas §24.10).
