# 🌾 Agriculture — Missing or Planned Files

> **Purpose.** Inventory the files that the Agriculture domain is doctrinally expected to grow into across every responsibility root, distinguishing what is **PROPOSED** by KFM doctrine from what is **NEEDS VERIFICATION**, **UNKNOWN**, or pending an **ADR**. This is a planning artifact, not a status claim.

## 1. Scope & posture

This file enumerates the **paths and artifacts that the Agriculture domain is doctrinally expected to host**, organized along the lane pattern from `directory-rules.md` §12 (Domain Placement Law). Each entry is labeled with a truth posture so the reader can distinguish doctrine-grounded intent from current implementation state.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Repository is not mounted in this session.** Nothing in this file asserts that a path exists, is wired, or is enforced. Every concrete path is `PROPOSED` unless verified against a mounted repo, schema validator output, test result, or release receipt. *(Atlas v1.1 §9 N; ENCY Appendix J–K; DIRRULES §1.)*

> [!NOTE]
> This is a **planning inventory**, not a runbook and not an ADR. Where an entry has architectural consequences (e.g., the home of `AggregationReceipt` schemas, new connector roots), it is flagged for **ADR triage** rather than resolved here.

### 1.1 What this file is

- A **lane-by-lane checklist** of Agriculture files the project expects under Directory Rules §12.
- A **bridge** from the Atlas v1.1 §9 dossier and Encyclopedia §7.7 into concrete planning entries.
- A **source of seed entries** for `docs/registers/VERIFICATION_BACKLOG.md` and the Agriculture portion of the per-domain Definition of Done.

### 1.2 What this file is **not**

- ❌ A repo status report — it does not claim any path is present.
- ❌ An ADR — schema-home, receipt-home, and connector-root questions are flagged, not decided.
- ❌ A schedule — it does not assign owners, dates, or priority beyond doctrine.
- ❌ A public commitment — public-facing roadmaps live in `docs/governance/` or release notes, not here.

## 4. Missing or planned files — by responsibility root

For each lane the table lists files **the Agriculture dossier and Directory Rules together imply should exist**. Every row is `PROPOSED` unless otherwise noted. Per-row status is a **planning** label, not a repo claim.

Legend: 🟦 *intent grounded in Atlas/Encyclopedia* · 🟨 *lane required by Directory Rules contract* · 🟧 *blocked on an ADR* · ⛔ *deny-by-default scope*

### 4.1 `docs/domains/agriculture/`

[⤴ Back to top](#-contents)

### 4.2 `contracts/domains/agriculture/`

`contracts/` defines **object meaning** in Markdown (DIRRULES §6.3). Each object family from Atlas v1.1 §9 E should have a meaning page.

| File (PROPOSED) | Object family | Truth label |
|---|---|---|
| `README.md` | Folder contract per §15 | 🟨 PROPOSED |

[⤴ Back to top](#-contents)

### 4.3 `schemas/contracts/v1/domains/agriculture/`

`schemas/contracts/v1/...` is the **canonical machine-schema home** per `ADR-0001` (DIRRULES §6.4, §13.1). One JSON Schema per object family, mirrored by `schemas/tests/valid/` and `schemas/tests/invalid/` fixtures.

<details>
<summary><b>Planned schema files (click to expand)</b></summary>

| File (PROPOSED) | Pairs with contract |

</details>

> [!WARNING]
> **No parallel schema homes.** Any `contracts/<domain>/<x>.schema.json` discovered later is **CONFLICTED / LEGACY** under ADR-0001 and must migrate to `schemas/contracts/v1/...`. *(DIRRULES §13.1.)*

[⤴ Back to top](#-contents)

### 4.4 `policy/domains/agriculture/`

`policy/` is the **canonical singular** for admissibility (DIRRULES §6.5). Any `policies/` mirror is compatibility-only.

| File (PROPOSED) | Purpose | Truth label |
|---|---|---|
| `README.md` | Folder contract per §15 | 🟨 PROPOSED |
| `sensitivity.<ext>` | Field-level vs aggregate redaction rules; farm/operator joins fail closed. | 🟦 PROPOSED · syntax NEEDS VERIFICATION (Rego/OPA assumed) |
| `rights.<ext>` | Per-source license posture (NASS, NRCS, SSURGO/SDA, Mesonet, NASA HLS/SMAP, NOAA USCRN). | 🟦 PROPOSED |
| `promotion.<ext>` | Agriculture-specific gates for `PROCESSED → CATALOG → PUBLISHED`. | 🟦 PROPOSED |
| `redaction_profiles.yaml` | County/HUC/grid generalization profiles invoked by `AggregationReceipt`. | 🟦 PROPOSED |
| `deny_by_default/<...>` | ⛔ Unreviewed exact sensitive Agriculture locations or private operator data → DENY. | ⛔ DENY-by-default · ATLAS §9 L |

[⤴ Back to top](#-contents)

### 4.5 `tests/domains/agriculture/` + `fixtures/domains/agriculture/`

Atlas v1.1 §9 K names the required validators. Each validator should have at least one positive and one negative fixture, with **no-network** fixtures preferred for the first proof slice.

| Test family (PROPOSED) | What it proves | Truth label |
|---|---|---|
| `schema_validation/` | JSON Schema conformance per object family | 🟦 PROPOSED |
| `source_descriptor/` | `SourceDescriptor` shape and required fields | 🟦 PROPOSED |
| `rights_validation/` | License / rights closure per source family | 🟦 PROPOSED |
| `sensitivity_validation/` | Tier assignment + transform receipts | 🟦 PROPOSED |
| `evidence_closure/` | `EvidenceRef → EvidenceBundle` resolves before release | 🟦 PROPOSED |
| `temporal_logic/` | Distinct observed / source / retrieval / release / correction times | 🟦 PROPOSED |
| `geometry_validity/` | Field polygon / county / HUC integrity | 🟦 PROPOSED |
| `policy_deny/` | DENY paths fire (e.g., field-level operator joins to public) | 🟦 PROPOSED |
| `citation_validation/` | Claims carry resolvable citations | 🟦 PROPOSED |
| `release_manifest/` | `ReleaseManifest` schema + binding | 🟦 PROPOSED |
| `rollback_drill/` | Rollback card restores prior released manifest | 🟦 PROPOSED |
| `no_network/` | Pipelines run on fixtures, no live external calls | 🟦 PROPOSED |
| `non_regression/` | Prior lineage preserved on re-promotion | 🟦 PROPOSED |
| `aggregation_threshold/` | Public-safe county/HUC/grid thresholds enforced | 🟦 PROPOSED |
| `source_role_mismatch/` | Source-role downcast/upcast rejected | 🟦 PROPOSED |
| `stale_state/` | Stale-data badge or denial fires as required | 🟦 PROPOSED |

Companion fixtures (PROPOSED) live under `fixtures/domains/agriculture/`:

```

> [!TIP]
> Per DIRRULES §13.5 (Fixture sprawl), pick **one** fixture home authority for Agriculture (`fixtures/domains/agriculture/` is the lane home; `tests/fixtures/` is acceptable only if the repo already centralizes there). Document the rule in both READMEs.

[⤴ Back to top](#-contents)

### 4.6 `pipelines/domains/agriculture/` + `pipeline_specs/agriculture/`

`pipeline_specs/` is **what** runs (declarative); `pipelines/` is **how** it runs (executable). *(DIRRULES §7.4.)*

| Pipeline / spec (PROPOSED) | Stage(s) | Truth label |
|---|---|---|
| `ingest_nass_cdl/` · `nass_cdl.yaml` | RAW · NASS Cropland Data Layer | 🟦 PROPOSED |
| `ingest_nass_quickstats/` · `nass_quickstats.yaml` | RAW · NASS QuickStats / Crop Progress | 🟦 PROPOSED |
| `ingest_ssurgo_sda/` · `ssurgo_sda.yaml` | RAW · SSURGO via Soil Data Access | 🟦 PROPOSED |

| `rollback/` | Release rollback via `RollbackCard` | 🟦 PROPOSED |

[⤴ Back to top](#-contents)

### 4.7 `connectors/<source>/…` (Agriculture sources)

> [!NOTE]
> Connectors are **source-specific**, not domain-specific — they live as their own roots, not under `connectors/domains/agriculture/`. *(DIRRULES §7.3.)*  Each connector outputs to `data/raw/agriculture/<source_id>/<run_id>/` only.

| Connector path (PROPOSED) | Source family | Truth label |
|---|---|---|
| `connectors/usda/nass/` *(new root segment)* | USDA NASS CDL + QuickStats / Crop Progress | 🟦 PROPOSED · root-segment NEEDS VERIFICATION |
| `connectors/nrcs/ssurgo/` | SSURGO / Soil Data Access | 🟦 PROPOSED |
| `connectors/nrcs/scan/` | NRCS SCAN | 🟦 PROPOSED |
| `connectors/kansas/mesonet/` | Kansas Mesonet | 🟦 PROPOSED |
| `connectors/noaa/uscrn/` | NOAA USCRN | 🟦 PROPOSED |
| `connectors/nasa/smap/` *(new root segment)* | NASA SMAP | 🟦 PROPOSED · root-segment NEEDS VERIFICATION |
| `connectors/nasa/hls/` *(new root segment)* | NASA HLS / HLS-VI | 🟦 PROPOSED · root-segment NEEDS VERIFICATION |

> [!WARNING]
> **Connectors do not publish.** A connector that writes to `data/processed/`, `data/catalog/`, or `data/published/` is an anti-pattern per DIRRULES §13.5. *(Promotion is a governed state transition, not a connector side-effect.)*

[⤴ Back to top](#-contents)

### 4.8 `data/<phase>/agriculture/`

Each lifecycle phase has its own Agriculture lane. Receipts, proofs, registry, and rollback content are emitted **alongside** these lanes — never as a replacement. *(DIRRULES §4 step 2; §6.)*

| Lane (PROPOSED) | Phase | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `data/raw/agriculture/<source_id>/<run_id>/` | RAW | Immutable connector output + ingest receipts |
| `data/work/agriculture/` | WORK | In-flight normalization & validation |
| `data/quarantine/agriculture/` | QUARANTINE | Records held for rights / sensitivity / source-role review |
| `data/processed/agriculture/` | PROCESSED | Normalized objects + `ValidationReport` + digest closure |
| `data/catalog/domain/agriculture/` | CATALOG | `EvidenceBundle`s, graph/triplet projections, release candidates |
| `data/published/layers/agriculture/` | PUBLISHED | Public-safe layers behind `apps/governed-api/` only |

[⤴ Back to top](#-contents)

### 4.9 `data/registry/sources/agriculture/`

One `SourceDescriptor` per source family from Atlas v1.1 §9 D. Each descriptor names source role, rights, cadence, steward, sensitivity tier, and release class.

```text
data/registry/sources/agriculture/
├── README.md
├── nass_cdl.yaml
├── nass_quickstats.yaml
├── ssurgo_sda.yaml
├── gssurgo.yaml
├── mesonet.yaml
├── nrcs_scan.yaml
├── noaa_uscrn.yaml
├── smap.yaml
└── hls_vi.yaml
```

All entries 🟦 PROPOSED; rights for every entry are **NEEDS VERIFICATION** per Atlas §9 D.

[⤴ Back to top](#-contents)

### 4.10 `release/candidates/agriculture/`

Release decisions, not artifacts. Released artifacts live in `data/published/`; **decisions** live here.

| File (PROPOSED) | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `county_year_panel_v0/release_manifest.json` | First-slice ReleaseManifest binding evidence, policy, sensitivity, rollback target |
| `county_year_panel_v0/rollback_card.json` | Drilled rollback target for the first slice |
| `county_year_panel_v0/promotion_decision.json` | Recorded promotion / deny / abstain |

[⤴ Back to top](#-contents)

### 4.11 `packages/domains/agriculture/`

> [!NOTE]
> A package belongs here **only if it is reusable across deployables**. A one-off pipeline step does not get a package home — it belongs in `pipelines/` or `tools/`. *(DIRRULES §7.2.)* Until a reusable surface is identified, this lane is `UNKNOWN` whether it should exist at all.

| Candidate (PROPOSED) | Truth label |
|---|---|
| `packages/domains/agriculture/` | UNKNOWN · NEEDS VERIFICATION that a reusable agriculture package is justified before creation |

## 5. First credible thin slice — county crop-year panel

The Agriculture dossier names a **county-level crop-year panel** as the first credible slice. Building it exercises every gate without exposing field-level sensitivity.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  CDL[NASS CDL] --> RAW
  QS[NASS QuickStats] --> RAW
  SSURGO[SSURGO via SDA] --> RAW
  MESO[Kansas Mesonet] --> RAW
  RAW[data/raw/agriculture/*] --> WORK[Normalize + Validate]
  WORK --> PROC[Processed objects + ValidationReport]
  PROC --> CAT[Catalog + EvidenceBundle]
  CAT --> CAND[release/candidates/agriculture/county_year_panel_v0/]
  CAND -->|PromotionDecision| PUB[Published county/HUC layers]
  PUB --> API[apps/governed-api/]
```

**Slice acceptance (PROPOSED, per Build Manual §31 alignment):**

- [ ] `SourceDescriptor` for each source admitted with rights confirmed.
- [ ] No-network fixture passes for `nass_cdl`, `nass_quickstats`, `ssurgo_sda`, `mesonet`.
- [ ] `EvidenceRef → EvidenceBundle` resolves for every public claim.
- [ ] Sensitivity policy DENIES field-level operator joins by default.
- [ ] `AggregationReceipt` recorded for county/HUC roll-ups.
- [ ] `ReleaseManifest` + `RollbackCard` exist before public surface binds.
- [ ] Public surface reads only via `apps/governed-api/`, never `data/processed/`.

## 6. Verification backlog

Lifted from Atlas v1.1 §9 N and ENCY Appendix J–K, scoped to Agriculture. Each item is **NEEDS VERIFICATION** until evidence (mounted repo files, schemas, registry entries, tests, logs, emitted artifacts, review records, or release manifests) is produced in a session.

| # | Item | Evidence that would settle it | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| AG-V-01 | NASS / QuickStats / Crop Progress source activation | source descriptor in `data/registry/sources/agriculture/`, ingest receipt | NEEDS VERIFICATION |
| AG-V-02 | Kansas Mesonet and NASA HLS / SMAP product terms | rights record per descriptor; license check in policy tests | NEEDS VERIFICATION |
| AG-V-03 | Public release sensitivity rules for farm/operator joins | policy fixtures + deny tests in `tests/domains/agriculture/policy_deny/` | NEEDS VERIFICATION |
| AG-V-04 | Agriculture API surface and layer registry | route under `apps/governed-api/` + `LayerManifest` in catalog | NEEDS VERIFICATION |
| AG-V-05 | `AggregationReceipt` schema home | ADR-S-03 resolution; presence at canonical home | NEEDS VERIFICATION · ADR-class |
| AG-V-06 | New connector roots (`connectors/usda/`, `connectors/nasa/`) | per-root READMEs declaring class and source descriptor reference | NEEDS VERIFICATION |
| AG-V-07 | Per-source rights closure (SSURGO, gSSURGO, Mesonet, SCAN, USCRN, SMAP, HLS, NASS) | rights record + test | NEEDS VERIFICATION |
| AG-V-08 | Aggregation threshold values (county/HUC/grid) | values committed in `policy/domains/agriculture/redaction_profiles.yaml` | NEEDS VERIFICATION |

## 7. Open ADRs touched by this inventory

These are not decided here. Listed so reviewers can route the right question to `docs/adr/`.

| Reference | Question | Why ADR-class |
|---|---|---|
| ADR-S-01 | Confirm `schemas/contracts/v1/...` as canonical schema home (or amend). | DIRRULES §2.4(3) — schema-home is ADR-required. |
| ADR-S-03 | Receipt class home: `schemas/contracts/v1/receipts/` vs. `schemas/contracts/v1/domains/agriculture/receipts/` for `AggregationReceipt`. | New parallel home is ADR-class per DIRRULES §2.4(5). |
| ADR-S-04 | Source-role enum — vocabulary stability across Agriculture sources. | Source-role anti-collapse is doctrine-significant. |
| ADR-S-05 | Sensitivity tier scheme (T0–T4) for Agriculture lanes — adopt or revise. | Affects per-domain release posture and redaction profiles. |
| ADR-CN-01 *(PROPOSED title)* | New connector roots `connectors/usda/`, `connectors/nasa/` — accept or fold into existing roots. | DIRRULES §2.4(1) — new root requires ADR. |
