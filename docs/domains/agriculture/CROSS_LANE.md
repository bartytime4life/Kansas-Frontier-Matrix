# 🌾 Agriculture — Cross-Lane Edge Contracts

> The per-edge operational contract for every cross-lane relationship the Agriculture bounded context owns or participates in. Specifies which objects flow across each edge, on what identity / join keys, under what source-role discipline, what sensitivity transforms apply, what outcomes are returned, what validators enforce it, and how corrections cascade across the edge.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **What this doc is — and what it is not.** This is the **per-edge operational contract** for Agriculture cross-lane relationships. The architectural overview lives in [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) §10; the wire-level envelope contract lives in [`api-contracts.md`](API_CONTRACTS.md) §9; the carry-forward register lives in [`CONTINUITY_INVENTORY.md`](./CONTINUITY_INVENTORY.md) §8. **This doc is where you go when the question is *"how exactly does this edge work?"***.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Source-role discipline applies on every edge.** A cross-lane edge **never** upgrades a source role. A NASS aggregate joined to a People/Land parcel is still an aggregate; an SMAP modeled grid joined to a Soil map-unit is still modeled; a CDL classification joined to a Hydrology HUC is still modeled. Promotion across an edge is forbidden. `[CONFIRMED — Atlas §24.1, §24.9.3.]`

> [!WARNING]
> **Where Atlas v1.0 disagrees with this doc, Atlas v1.0 governs.** This doc captures the per-edge specifics that the Atlas summarizes; any divergence is treated as a drift entry against this file, **not** a correction to Atlas. `[CONFIRMED — ENCY §24 reading guidance.]`

## 1 · Purpose & scope

This document specifies, for each cross-lane edge that Agriculture participates in:

- **Direction** — does Agriculture *consume from* the other lane, *cite into* the other lane, or *inform* (advisory) the other lane?
- **Object families** that flow across the edge.
- **Identity / join keys** (PROPOSED; verifiable against schemas).
- **Source-role discipline** (which roles are admissible on this edge; which are forbidden).
- **Sensitivity disposition** (default tier; required transforms; deny rules).
- **Outcome grammar** the edge returns when invoked through the trust membrane.
- **Validators** that enforce edge conformance.
- **Correction-cascade direction** when an upstream claim is corrected.

It does **not** specify wire-level DTO field names (those live in [`api-contracts.md`](API_CONTRACTS.md) §5) or repo placement (that lives in [`CANONICAL_PATHS.md`](./CANONICAL_PATHS.md) §9). Where this doc touches those concerns, it cross-references.

<a id="sec-3-taxonomy"></a>

## 3 · Edge taxonomy

Every cross-lane edge falls into exactly one of the categories below. The category determines what kind of contract the edge has.

| Category | Definition | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Consume from owner** | Agriculture reads objects from the owning lane via `EvidenceRef`, never re-publishes the source content as Agriculture truth. | Agriculture consumes Soil's `SoilMapUnit` (MUKEY) for `SoilCropSuitability`. |
| **Cite into owner's lane** | Agriculture provides context that the owning lane may cite. | Agriculture's `DroughtStressIndicator` cited as context by Hazards (advisory only). |
| **Inform (advisory)** | Agriculture provides context the other lane *may* use, with no obligation; never regulatory. | Agriculture's `PestStressIndicator` informs Fauna disease surveillance — advisory only. |
| **Restricted (deny-default)** | Edge is **denied by default**; promotion requires explicit steward review + named agreement. | Agriculture × People/Land: any join that resolves to identifiable operator/parcel. |
| **Forbidden** | Edge MUST NOT exist; surfacing the edge is a §13.5 anti-pattern or a §24.9.2 trust-membrane violation. | Agriculture-as-alert-authority to Hazards; Agriculture-as-regulatory to Hydrology. |
| **Reciprocal (matrix-cell)** | Agriculture publishes inputs to Frontier Matrix cells; the matrix cell's correction cascades back as `revoke_upstream`. | Agriculture county-year aggregates → Frontier Matrix cells. |

**Default disposition.** Edges with `restricted` or unresolved category default to `DENY` per [`policy-aware.md`](../../doctrine/policy-aware.md).

## 5 · Edge: Agriculture × Soil

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Category** | Consume from owner |
| **Direction** | Agriculture **consumes** Soil objects via `EvidenceRef`. Agriculture **MUST NOT** re-publish Soil objects as Agriculture canonical. |
| **Atlas reference** | §24.4.7 · §9.F · Atlas §24.13 (object-family × domain matrix) |
| **Object families consumed (Soil-owned)** | `SoilMapUnit` · `SoilComponent` · `Horizon` · `SoilProperty` · `Hydrologic Soil Group` · `Pedon` · `SuitabilityRating` |
| **Object families produced (Agriculture-owned)** | `SoilCropSuitability` (consumes Soil; produces Agriculture-modeled derivative) |
| **Identity / join keys (PROPOSED)** | **`MUKEY`** (map-unit) · `COKEY` (component) · `CHKEY` (horizon). Set at admission in Soil's `SourceDescriptor`; preserved verbatim across the join. |
| **Source-role discipline** | Agriculture's downstream object inherits `role = modeled`. Soil's `Pedon` data crossing as `observed` MUST NOT be relabeled `modeled` after the join. SSURGO `Hydrologic Soil Group` crosses as `regulatory` and MUST stay `regulatory`. `[Atlas §24.1.]` |
| **Sensitivity disposition** | T0 (open) for aggregate suitability over public-safe Soil units. Field-level joins follow Agriculture's field-level deny-default (see §13 People/Land). |
| **Outcome grammar** | `ANSWER` when MUKEY resolves and Soil `EvidenceBundle` is releaseable; `ABSTAIN` if Soil source is stale or revoked upstream; `ERROR` on malformed MUKEY. |
| **Validators (PROPOSED)** | `validate_mukey_join` · `validate_soil_role_preservation` · `validate_hydrologic_group_regulatory` · `validate_suitability_run_receipt` |
| **Correction cascade** | Soil-side correction (`CorrectionNotice` on `SoilMapUnit`) → Agriculture `SoilCropSuitability` downgrades to `ABSTAIN evidence.revoked_upstream` on next call per [`trust-membrane.md`](../../doctrine/trust-membrane.md) §8. |
| **Forbidden** | Re-publishing `SoilMapUnit` under `schemas/contracts/v1/domains/agriculture/`. Re-labeling Soil's `Pedon` as Agriculture `CropObservation`. Joining sensitive Soil pedon coords into a public Agriculture surface without `RedactionReceipt`. |

> [!NOTE]
> **MUKEY is the load-bearing join key for the Agriculture × Soil edge.** Any Agriculture object that joins to Soil but cannot resolve MUKEY MUST `ABSTAIN` with reason `mukey_unresolved`. `[CONFIRMED — DOM-AG §C; Atlas §24.4.7.]`

| **Object families produced (Agriculture-owned)** | `IrrigationLink` (consumes Hydrology gauge / withdrawal; produces Agriculture-observed link record) |
| **Identity / join keys (PROPOSED)** | **`huc_id`** (HUC-8 / HUC-10 / HUC-12) · `reach_id` (NHD reach) · `gauge_id`. Set at admission in Hydrology's `SourceDescriptor`. |
| **Source-role discipline** | `NFHLZone` is `regulatory` and MUST stay `regulatory` — **never relabeled as observed flood event**. `GaugeSite` readings are `observed` and stay `observed`. `[Atlas §24.1; §24.1.2 anti-collapse failure modes.]` |
| **Sensitivity disposition** | T0 for aggregate HUC-level joins. Field-level irrigation withdrawals linked to identifiable operators follow Agriculture's deny-default. |
| **Outcome grammar** | `ANSWER` when HUC or reach resolves and Hydrology `EvidenceBundle` is releaseable; `ABSTAIN` if upstream gauge is stale per freshness window. |
| **Validators (PROPOSED)** | `validate_huc_join` · `validate_nfhl_regulatory_preservation` · `validate_gauge_id_resolves` · `validate_irrigation_link_rights` |
| **Correction cascade** | Hydrology-side correction → Agriculture `IrrigationLink` and downstream `DroughtStressIndicator` (where it cites flow data) downgrade to `ABSTAIN`. |
| **Forbidden** | Citing `NFHLZone` as if it were an observed flood event in Agriculture context. Re-publishing flow observations under Agriculture. Joining private water-withdrawal records into a public Agriculture surface. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **NFHL regulatory provenance MUST be preserved across this edge.** Agriculture surfaces that cite NFHL regulatory zones MUST render them with the regulatory banner per [`api-contracts.md`](API_CONTRACTS.md) §3 — never as observed events. `[CONFIRMED — Atlas §24.1.2; §24.9.2.]`

| **Identity / join keys (PROPOSED)** | `station_id` · `grid_cell_id` (for `AODRaster`) · temporal window. |
| **Source-role discipline** | `AirObservation` is `observed`; `AODRaster` is `modeled`. Agriculture's `DroughtStressIndicator` inherits `role = modeled` whether built from observed weather or modeled grids. `[Atlas §24.1.]` |
| **Sensitivity disposition** | T0. No sensitive joins on this edge by default. |
| **Outcome grammar** | `ANSWER` with model identity cited; `ABSTAIN` if upstream station offline or freshness window lapsed. |
| **Validators (PROPOSED)** | `validate_station_id_resolves` · `validate_aod_raster_role` · `validate_stress_indicator_model_identity` |
| **Correction cascade** | Atmosphere-side correction → Agriculture `DroughtStressIndicator` re-evaluates inputs at next call. |
| **Forbidden** | Framing Agriculture-derived stress indicators as **alerts** or **life-safety guidance**. KFM is not an alert authority. `[Atlas §24.9.2.]` |

<a id="sec-8-habitat"></a>

## 8 · Edge: Agriculture × Habitat

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Category** | Reciprocal (consumes ↔ informs) |

| **Atlas reference** | §24.4.4 (Habitat owns) · §24.4.7 (Agriculture owns) |
| **Object families consumed (Habitat-owned)** | `HabitatPatch` · `Habitat Quality Score` · `EcologicalSystem` · `StewardshipZone` |
| **Object families produced (Agriculture-owned)** | `ConservationPractice` (framed by Habitat-quality scores; never an imperative recommendation) |
| **Identity / join keys (PROPOSED)** | `habitat_patch_id` · `ecological_system_id` · spatial intersection. |
| **Source-role discipline** | `HabitatPatch` is `modeled` (often a derivative of land-cover classification); preserved as modeled across the edge. |
| **Sensitivity disposition** | T0 for public-safe habitat patches; sensitive habitat (e.g., rare-species habitat) is owned by Habitat and **denied** to Agriculture for public surfaces. `[Atlas §24.4.4.]` |
| **Outcome grammar** | `ANSWER` (framing only); never an instruction outcome. |
| **Validators (PROPOSED)** | `validate_habitat_patch_id_resolves` · `validate_conservation_practice_not_instruction` |
| **Correction cascade** | Habitat-side correction → Agriculture `ConservationPractice` framing re-evaluates. |
| **Forbidden** | Agriculture framing Habitat-derived context as **land-management instruction**. Agriculture publishing sensitive habitat coordinates received from Habitat. `[Atlas §24.4.4.]` |

> [!NOTE]
> **Conservation-practice framing, not instruction.** Agriculture's `ConservationPractice` MUST be framed as context, not as imperative guidance to landowners. Any text or surface that resolves to instruction MUST `DENY` publication. `[CONFIRMED — Atlas §24.4.4.]`

## 9 · Edge: Agriculture × Fauna

| Field | Value |
|---|---|

| **Identity / join keys (PROPOSED)** | `taxon_id` (e.g., ITIS TSN, GBIF taxon key) · `taxon_authority`. |
| **Source-role discipline** | Fauna `Taxon` is `administrative` (registry record). Agriculture's `PestStressIndicator` inherits `role = modeled`. Fauna `Occurrence Restricted` MUST NOT cross to Agriculture public surfaces. |
| **Sensitivity disposition** | T0 for public taxonomic identity. Sensitive Fauna occurrence (e.g., rare-species locations) is owned by Fauna and **denied** to Agriculture's public surfaces. `[Atlas §24.4.5.]` |

## 11 · Edge: Agriculture × Geology

| Field | Value |

## 12 · Edge: Agriculture × Hazards

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Category** | Cite into owner's lane (context only) |
| **Direction** | Agriculture's stress indicators **cite into** Hazards as hazard context. Agriculture **MUST NOT** frame its output as alert or life-safety guidance. |
| **Atlas reference** | §24.4.7 · §24.9.2 (KFM-as-alert-authority anti-pattern) |
| **Object families Hazards consumes from Agriculture** | `DroughtStressIndicator` · `PestStressIndicator` (both as hazard context only) |
| **Object families produced (Hazards-owned)** | Hazards' `Hazard Event` and `Advisory Context` MAY cite Agriculture stress indicators. |
| **Identity / join keys (PROPOSED)** | `temporal_window` · `spatial_scope` (county / HUC / grid). |
| **Source-role discipline** | Agriculture's stress indicators cross as `modeled`; Hazards preserves the role and **never** relabels them `regulatory`. |
| **Sensitivity disposition** | T0. Public-safe by default. |
| **Outcome grammar** | `ANSWER` (with non-emergency disclaimer); never an alert outcome. |
| **Validators (PROPOSED)** | `validate_stress_indicator_not_alert` · `validate_hazard_citation_provenance` · `validate_no_life_safety_framing` |
| **Correction cascade** | Agriculture-side correction → Hazards re-evaluates context citations. |
| **Forbidden** | **KFM-as-alert-authority** — the highest-severity anti-pattern at this edge. Agriculture stress data MUST NOT be presented as a regulatory hazard determination, life-safety guidance, or emergency response instruction. `[CONFIRMED — Atlas §24.9.2; DOM-AG §G.]` |

> [!WARNING]
> **KFM is not an alert authority.** Any rendering of Agriculture-derived drought or pest indicators in a manner that resolves to "alert," "advisory," "warning," or "emergency guidance" is a §24.9.2 anti-pattern and MUST `DENY` at publication. Authoritative alerts are owned by Hazards / Atmosphere / Hydrology under their regulatory provenance. `[CONFIRMED — Atlas §24.9.2.]`

## 13 · Edge: Agriculture × People / Land

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Category** | **Restricted (deny-default)** |
| **Direction** | Agriculture **MAY** consume People/Land context **only** under explicit steward review + named agreement + `RedactionReceipt`. **The default disposition is `DENY` public.** |
| **Atlas reference** | §24.4.7 · §24.5.2 (sensitivity tier matrix) · operating contract §23.2 (sensitive-domain matrix) |
| **Object families consumed (People/Land-owned; restricted)** | `LandParcel` · `Person Assertion` · `PersonCanonical` · `Residence Event` |
| **Object families produced (Agriculture-owned; restricted)** | `FieldCandidate` (when resolved to identifiable parcel) · `SupplyChainNode` (when resolved to identifiable operator) |
| **Identity / join keys (PROPOSED)** | `parcel_id` · `operator_id`. **Resolving these to identifiable people MUST trigger DENY public + HOLD for steward review.** |
| **Source-role discipline** | People/Land objects cross as `administrative`. Agriculture MUST NOT relabel them `observed` even when joined to Agriculture observations. |
| **Sensitivity disposition** | **T4** (denied) for any join that resolves to identifiable operator/parcel. **T1** (generalized) only after aggregation to county/HUC/grid above the k-anon threshold + `RedactionReceipt`. `[Atlas §24.5.2.]` |
| **Outcome grammar** | `DENY` (with reason `person_parcel_join_denied`) by default; `ANSWER` only with explicit steward `ALLOW` + `RedactionReceipt`. |

| **Correction cascade** | People/Land-side correction → Agriculture immediately withdraws any derivative that joined the affected person/parcel; `WithdrawalNotice` issued. |
| **Forbidden** | Publishing any Agriculture surface that joins to identifiable operator or parcel **without** steward `ALLOW` + `RedactionReceipt`. Publishing FSA CLU (operator-identifiable) on any public surface. Publishing private yield records. Publishing pesticide-use records keyed to operator. `[CONFIRMED — Atlas §24.5.2; DOM-AG §I; operating contract §23.2.]` |

## 14 · Edge: Agriculture × Frontier Matrix

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Category** | Reciprocal (matrix-cell input) |
| **Direction** | Agriculture **publishes** aggregate county-year crop and yield observations as Frontier Matrix cell inputs. Frontier Matrix cells **cascade corrections** back to Agriculture via `revoke_upstream`. |
| **Atlas reference** | §24.4.7 · §24.13 (object-family × domain matrix) · trust-membrane.md §8 (correction propagation) |
| **Object families Agriculture publishes to matrix** | `Yield Observation` (county-year aggregate) · `CropObservation` (county-year aggregate) · `Agricultural Economy Observation` (county-year aggregate) |
| **Object families consumed from Matrix** | Frontier Matrix `GeographyVersion` (county-year boundary) · `Population Observation` (denominator for per-capita ag economy figures) |
| **Identity / join keys (PROPOSED)** | `county_fips` · `year` · `geography_version_id`. **Every input MUST resolve to a specific `GeographyVersion`** — county boundaries are not assumed stable across time. |
| **Source-role discipline** | Agriculture inputs are `aggregate`; Frontier Matrix cells preserve the aggregate role. |
| **Sensitivity disposition** | T0 for public-safe aggregates above k-anon thresholds. |
| **Outcome grammar** | `ANSWER` with **`AggregationReceipt` REQUIRED**; `ABSTAIN aggregation_receipt_missing` otherwise. |
| **Validators (PROPOSED)** | `validate_aggregation_receipt_present` · `validate_county_fips_resolves` · `validate_geography_version_pinned` · `validate_revocation_propagation_test` |
| **Correction cascade** | **Bidirectional.** Agriculture-side correction → emits `CorrectionNotice`; downstream Frontier Matrix cells downgrade to `ABSTAIN evidence.revoked_upstream` at next call. Matrix-side correction (e.g., `GeographyVersion` revision) → Agriculture re-evaluates which county-year scope applied. `[CONFIRMED — trust-membrane.md §8.]` |
| **Forbidden** | Publishing field-level Agriculture data to a matrix cell (matrix cells are inherently aggregate). Publishing without `AggregationReceipt`. Citing a county-year aggregate as a per-place truth (Atlas §24.1.2 anti-collapse failure). |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **`AggregationReceipt` is load-bearing on this edge.** Every Agriculture input to a Frontier Matrix cell MUST resolve an `AggregationReceipt`. The validator at this edge — `validate_aggregation_receipt_present` — is in §17 below and is one of the most consequential cross-lane validators in KFM. `[CONFIRMED — Atlas §24.13; ARCHITECTURE.md §5.]`

<a id="sec-15-touch-edges"></a>

## 15 · Touch edges (rare, advisory)

These edges are real but exercised rarely. They are listed for completeness so the trust-membrane validators do not silently allow them as if they were unspecified.

### 15.1 Agriculture × Settlements / Infrastructure

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Category** | Touch (advisory) |
| **Direction** | Agriculture **MAY** cite Settlements / Infrastructure context (e.g., grain elevator location, rail siding) where it bears on `SupplyChainNode`. **Critical-asset deny lane** rules apply. |
| **Atlas reference** | §24.4 (implicit) · §24.5.2 (critical-asset deny lane) |
| **Sensitivity disposition** | Critical-asset locations are **denied** to public Agriculture surfaces. Aggregate supply-chain context is acceptable. |
| **Forbidden** | Publishing critical-asset coordinates on any public Agriculture surface. |

### 15.2 Agriculture × Archaeology

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Category** | Touch (steward-reviewed; rare) |
| **Direction** | Ethnobotanical context (via Flora) **MAY** bound archaeological site interpretation; never overrides cultural-heritage authority. Direct Agriculture × Archaeology citations are rare and require **steward review**. |
| **Atlas reference** | §24.4.6 (via Flora) |
| **Sensitivity disposition** | **T4 (denied)** for archaeological site coordinates. Any Agriculture surface that resolves to an archaeological location MUST `HOLD` for sovereignty + steward review. `[Atlas §24.5.2.]` |
| **Forbidden** | Publishing archaeological coordinates derived from Agriculture observations. Treating Agriculture context as overriding cultural-heritage authority. |

<a id="sec-16-correction-cascade"></a>

## 16 · Correction propagation across edges

When a published Agriculture claim is corrected, the correction propagates across every edge that consumed the corrected claim. Conversely, when an upstream lane corrects a claim that Agriculture consumed, Agriculture re-evaluates the affected derivatives.

### 16.2 Cascade matrix

| Originating correction | Affected Agriculture object(s) | Propagation outcome | Required artifact(s) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Soil `SoilMapUnit` revision (MUKEY change) | `SoilCropSuitability` | `ABSTAIN evidence.revoked_upstream` at next call | `CorrectionNotice` (Soil-side); Agriculture re-evaluates on next request |
| Hydrology `GaugeSite` calibration / `NFHLZone` revision | `IrrigationLink` · `DroughtStressIndicator` | `ABSTAIN evidence.revoked_upstream` | `CorrectionNotice` (Hydrology-side) |
| Atmosphere `Weather Station` QC fix | `DroughtStressIndicator` · `PestStressIndicator` | Re-evaluate at next call (freshness window) | `CorrectionNotice` (Atmosphere-side) |
| People/Land parcel-ownership correction | Any Agriculture derivative joining the affected person/parcel | **Immediate `WithdrawalNotice`** for affected derivatives | `WithdrawalNotice` · `RollbackCard` |
| Agriculture-side correction (e.g., CDL re-classification) | All downstream consumers (Matrix cells; Hazards citations; Fauna pest citations) | Downstream consumers `ABSTAIN evidence.revoked_upstream` at next call | `CorrectionNotice` (Agriculture-side) · `RollbackCard` if reverting |
| Fauna taxonomic revision | `PestStressIndicator` (taxon citation) | Re-evaluate taxon citation at next call | `CorrectionNotice` (Fauna-side) |
| Frontier Matrix `GeographyVersion` revision | Agriculture county-year aggregates | Re-evaluate county boundary at next call; aggregations may need re-run | `CorrectionNotice` (Matrix-side) |

`[CONFIRMED — trust-membrane.md §8; corrections-are-first-class.md; Atlas §24.4.7.]`

### 16.3 Push vs pull propagation

Whether revocation propagates **push** (proactive cell re-evaluation) or **pull** (cells re-evaluate on next call) is **OQ-AG-CL-09** below. Until resolved, this doc assumes **pull** propagation (consistent with trust-membrane.md §8 default), with the People/Land cascade as the exception (immediate `WithdrawalNotice` per §13).

- [ ] `docs/domains/agriculture/CROSS_LANE.md` exists with KFM Meta Block v2 and `contract_version: "3.0.0"`.
- [ ] All five sibling docs (`README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `api-contracts.md`, `CANONICAL_PATHS.md`, `CONTINUITY_INVENTORY.md`) cross-reference this document.

### 22.2 Edge coverage
- [ ] Every edge in §4 has a per-edge section (§5–§15) populated with the 12-field template.
- [ ] Every edge has at least one PROPOSED join-key documented or labeled UNKNOWN with an open question.
- [ ] Every restricted edge (§13 People/Land, §15.1 Settlements, §15.2 Archaeology) ships with an explicit DENY default in policy.

### 22.3 Validator coverage
- [ ] Every validator named in §17 ships with both valid and invalid fixtures under `tests/domains/agriculture/cross-lane/`.
- [ ] Every invalid fixture fails for the expected reason.
- [ ] Load-bearing validators (`validate_no_person_parcel_join_public`, `validate_aggregation_receipt_present`) are wired into CI as blocking gates.
- [ ] Cross-cutting validators (§17.2) are wired into the schema-validation pipeline.

### 22.4 Source-role and sensitivity conformance
- [ ] Source-role preservation tested across every cross-lane join (no upgrades).
- [ ] Person-parcel-join `DENY` default enforced on every public Agriculture envelope.
- [ ] Restricted-occurrence non-leak tests pass (Fauna, Flora, Archaeology).
- [ ] Critical-asset non-leak tests pass (Settlements/Infrastructure).
- [ ] NFHL regulatory preservation tested.

### 22.5 Correction cascade
- [ ] End-to-end correction-cascade test passes for Soil → Agriculture → Frontier Matrix.
- [ ] People/Land cascade triggers immediate `WithdrawalNotice` for affected Agriculture derivatives.
- [ ] Push vs pull propagation decision (OQ-AG-CL-09) ratified by ADR.

### 22.6 AI authoring discipline
- [ ] `validate_no_uncited_join` deployed at the Focus Mode surface.
- [ ] AI-authored cross-lane merges emit `GENERATED_RECEIPT.json` per operating contract §34.

### 22.7 Governance hygiene
- [ ] All open questions in §19 resolved or assigned to ADRs with active owners.
- [ ] All verification items in §20 tracked in `docs/registers/VERIFICATION_BACKLOG.md`.
- [ ] Drift between this document and live state logged in `docs/registers/DRIFT_REGISTER.md`.
- [ ] CODEOWNERS coverage extends to cross-domain reviewers for each edge.
- [ ] `GENERATED_RECEIPT.json` for this document wired into CI.
