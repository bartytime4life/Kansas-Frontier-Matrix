## 1. Purpose & scope

**Purpose.** This document defines the **contracts** — the DTOs, payload shapes, finite outcomes, and trust obligations — that the **Archaeology** lane exposes to KFM's **Map shell** and **UI surfaces** (catalog, popups, Evidence Drawer, time slider, Focus Mode, exports). It is the per-domain elaboration of cross-cutting Whole-UI / Governed-AI contracts; cross-cutting definitions live in their architecture homes, **not here**.

**Scope (in).**

- Domain-specific shape of `LayerManifest`, `LayerCatalogItem`, `LayerDescriptor`, `MapReleaseManifest`, `EvidenceDrawerPayload`, `RuntimeResponseEnvelope` (Archaeology projection), `FocusRequestEnvelope` / `FocusResponseEnvelope`, and related projections **as they apply to Archaeology**.
- Sensitivity, geometry-generalization, rights, sovereignty, and review obligations carried across every Map/UI boundary, expressed in the canonical **T0–T4 tier scheme** (Atlas v1.1 §24.5).
- The finite outcome grammar (`ANSWER` / `ABSTAIN` / `DENY` / `ERROR` / `HOLD` / validator-class `PASS` / `FAIL`, plus optional `NARROWED` / `BOUNDED`) and the obligations that accompany each.
- Cross-references to the validators, tests, fixtures, and receipts that prove these contracts hold.

**Scope (out).**

- Cross-cutting DTO definitions — those belong under `docs/architecture/ui/`, `docs/architecture/governed-ai/`, and `contracts/`.
- Map renderer internals, MapLibre runtime-adapter wiring, plugin-host construction — see `docs/architecture/maplibre-3d.md` and `packages/maplibre-runtime/`.
- Ingestion, source-descriptor lifecycle, and `RAW → PROCESSED` transforms — see the domain README and `data/registry/sources/archaeology/`.
- Schema files themselves — those live under `schemas/contracts/v1/...`. This doc references them; it does not own them.

> [!NOTE]
> **CONFIRMED doctrine.** Public clients and normal UI surfaces use **governed APIs and released payloads only**. No browser path reads canonical or candidate stores. Maps, tiles, popups, and AI text are downstream of the trust membrane — never substitutes for it. Source: `ai-build-operating-contract.md` §22.3; Atlas §24.9.2.

## 2. Repo fit & authority basis

| Concern | Where it lives | Status |
|---|---|---|
| This doc | `docs/domains/archaeology/MAP_UI_CONTRACTS.md` | placement **CONFIRMED** (Directory Rules §6.1 lists `docs/domains/archaeology/`); filename casing follows §6.1.a topical convention |
| Operating contract | `docs/doctrine/ai-build-operating-contract.md` | **CONFIRMED** (doctrine); v3.0.0 pinned |
| Directory Rules | `docs/doctrine/directory-rules.md` | **CONFIRMED** (doctrine); v1.3 active (MapLibre sole-renderer pending OPEN-DR-10) |
| Domain meaning (Markdown) | `contracts/domains/archaeology/` | **PROPOSED** placement per §12 Domain Placement Law; conflicts with Atlas §24.13 plain `contracts/archaeology/` — see OQ-AR-02 |
| Machine schemas (JSON Schema) | `schemas/contracts/v1/domains/archaeology/` | **PROPOSED** per ADR-0001 default + §12 Domain Placement Law; Atlas §24.13 uses plain `schemas/contracts/v1/archaeology/` — see OQ-AR-02 |
| Sensitivity & rights policy | `policy/domains/archaeology/` and `policy/sensitivity/archaeology/` | **PROPOSED** placement per §6.5; Atlas §24.13 lists `policy/sensitivity/archaeology/` only — see OQ-AR-03 |
| Fixtures (valid / invalid) | `tests/fixtures/domains/archaeology/` _or_ `fixtures/domains/archaeology/` | **NEEDS VERIFICATION** — Directory Rules §6.6 names both `tests/` and `fixtures/`; the canonical home for negative-case fixtures is OPEN |
| Tests (positive / negative) | `tests/domains/archaeology/` | **PROPOSED** |
| Governed API routes | `apps/governed-api/` (exact routes **UNKNOWN**) | **PROPOSED** |
| Map shell | `apps/explorer-web/` + `packages/ui/` + `packages/maplibre-runtime/` | **PROPOSED** per Directory Rules §13.3 (v1.3 retires `packages/maplibre/` and any `packages/cesium*` — see OPEN-DR-10) |

**Directory Rules basis.**

- Per `directory-rules.md` **§6.1**, `docs/domains/archaeology/` is the **CONFIRMED** canonical home for domain-facing prose.
- Per **§12 (Domain Placement Law)**, the domain name MUST appear as a **segment** inside each responsibility root — never as a root folder. Domain segments live under `docs/domains/`, `contracts/domains/`, `schemas/contracts/v1/domains/`, `policy/domains/`, `tests/domains/`, `fixtures/domains/`, `data/<phase>/<domain>/`, etc.
- Per **§13.3** (v1.3), the public shell consolidates under `apps/explorer-web/`, `packages/ui/`, and **`packages/maplibre-runtime/`** (sole governed renderer adapter; supersedes v1.2 `packages/maplibre/` + retired `packages/cesium/` per OPEN-DR-10).

> [!CAUTION]
> **Known doctrine drift — `domains/` segment.** Atlas v1.1 §24.13 lists schema and contract homes **without** the `domains/` segment (e.g., `schemas/contracts/v1/archaeology/`). Directory Rules §12 (v1.2) explicitly requires the segment (`schemas/contracts/v1/domains/archaeology/`). Per Directory Rules §2.5, Directory Rules governs placement; the conflict is a drift candidate for `docs/registers/DRIFT_REGISTER.md`. This doc adopts the §12 form and flags the conflict at **OQ-AR-02**.

## 3. Trust-membrane diagram

The diagram renders the **CONFIRMED doctrine** flow: canonical archaeology evidence is never read directly by the browser; the **governed API** resolves a finite `RuntimeResponseEnvelope` that carries the `EvidenceBundle` projection, the `PolicyDecision`, and any required obligations (CARE chip, sovereignty notice, `RedactionReceipt` reference) before pixels or text reach the client.

## 4. Contracts inventory

The contracts below are the **Archaeology lane's projection** of cross-cutting DTOs. Each row carries the truth label that applies to its **implementation maturity**; the **shape doctrine** (what the object is for) is **CONFIRMED** across the project per the operating-contract glossary (§9) and Atlas §24.2.

| Contract | Purpose in Archaeology lane | PROPOSED schema home | Truth label |
|---|---|---|---|
| `RuntimeResponseEnvelope` (Archaeology projection) | Finite outcome wrapper for archaeology feature / detail, layer-manifest, drawer, and Focus Mode responses | `schemas/contracts/v1/runtime/runtime_response_envelope.schema.json` (domain-discriminated payload) | shape **CONFIRMED** · path **PROPOSED** |

> [!TIP]
> Field-by-field schemas are owned by `schemas/contracts/v1/...` (machine shape) and `contracts/domains/archaeology/` (semantic meaning). This doc references them; it does not duplicate them. Drift between the two homes is an ADR-class concern per Directory Rules §13.1.

## 5. Map layer contracts

Archaeology layers are **derived, public-safe surfaces** built downstream of admitted evidence and approved sensitivity transforms. They are **never** direct projections of canonical archaeology records.

### 5.1 Layer families exposed to the Map shell

| Layer family | Default tier (Atlas §24.5.2) | Visibility | Geometry posture | Source role |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Public generalized site summaries | **T1** (post-`RedactionReceipt`) | public | generalized (≥ H3 r7 **PROPOSED**) | derived / aggregated |
| Survey coverage summaries | T0 | public | survey-extent polygons | observation summary |
| Candidate-feature surfaces (LiDAR, remote sensing, geophysics anomalies) | **T1** | public, **clearly labeled candidate** | generalized | candidate, not site |
| Chronology / `CulturalTemporalPeriod` layers | T0 | public, time-aware | generalized | derived |
| Steward-only exact-geometry review | **T2** | **restricted** | exact, access-gated | review surface |
| 3D site documentation | **T2** _(or T1 if generalized + `RepresentationReceipt` admitted)_ | **restricted** unless generalized | generalized 3D + Reality Boundary Note | review surface |
| Threat / risk review views | **T2** | **restricted** | varies | review surface |
| Human remains / sacred sites | **T4** | **denied to all public tiers** | n/a | not released; existence may be acknowledged only as steward review permits |

> [!WARNING]
> **CONFIRMED doctrine (sensitivity, rights, publication posture).** Exact archaeological locations, burial, human remains, sacred sites, unresolved cultural sensitivity, collection security, private landowner details, and looting-risk exposure **fail closed**. Public layers carry **generalized** geometry only; precise coordinates are never exposed without steward / rights-holder review. Source: Atlas Ch. 15 §I; operating contract §23.2 row "Archaeology — site locations" and "Burial / sacred sites".

### 5.2 Required `LayerManifest` carry-over fields (Archaeology)

For every archaeology layer that reaches the public Map shell, the `LayerManifest` MUST carry, at minimum:

- `layer_id`, `title`, `geometry_type`, `source_id`, `source_layer`
- `evidence_ref_field` — links each feature to its `EvidenceBundle`
- `temporal_fields` — source / observed / valid / retrieval / release / correction times kept distinct (Atlas Ch. 15 §E)
- `policy_label` — e.g., `public`, `restricted`, `steward-only`
- `release_state` — released vs. candidate vs. review-only
- `sensitivity_tier` ∈ { `T0`, `T1`, `T2`, `T3`, `T4` } + `care_status`
- `sensitive_flag` — boolean per operating contract §23.2 row "Rare species (occurrence)" pattern, generalized to archaeology
- `generalization_log_ref` — pointer to the `RedactionReceipt` / `PublicationTransformReceipt`
- `version`, `release_id` (resolves to a `MapReleaseManifest`), `rollback_target` (resolves to a `RollbackCard`)
- `freshness`, `stale_after`
- `correction_lineage` — `supersedes` / `superseded_by` chain

Field **set** is **CONFIRMED** doctrine; **exact field names are PROPOSED** until matched against the canonical schema.

### 5.3 3D handoff (sole renderer: `packages/maplibre-runtime/`)

> [!CAUTION]
> **Doctrine update (v1.3).** Directory Rules v1.3 names **MapLibre as the sole browser-side renderer**; the v1.2 dual-renderer (Cesium / MapLibre) posture is retired pending OPEN-DR-10 acceptance. **There is no separate Cesium handoff in the v1.3 doctrine target.** 3D scenes for archaeology are hosted **inside** `packages/maplibre-runtime/` via custom-layer wrappers (3D Tiles, glTF, LiDAR point clouds, deck.gl interleaved). The renderer is **not** the truth path; it consumes the same `EvidenceBundle`, `PolicyDecision`, and `RuntimeResponseEnvelope` as 2D layers.

3D scenes are **higher-exposure carriers**. Per **CONFIRMED doctrine**, 3D archaeology surfaces require:

- generalized or clipped geometry equivalent to the 2D public layer;
- a **Reality Boundary Note** distinguishing observed / modeled / synthetic surfaces (Atlas Ch. 18; operating contract §22.3);
- the **same** `EvidenceBundle` and `RuntimeResponseEnvelope` as the 2D path — 3D is an alternate **rendering mode**, not an alternate truth path;
- passage through the **3D Admission Decision** evaluator (`PolicyDecision` subtype) before any `setTerrain`, `setProjection({type:'globe'})`, or plugin-hosted layer is constructed (Directory Rules §7.2.a);
- a `RepresentationReceipt` (subtype of `RenderReceipt`) emitted after each render-frame batch;
- an ADR before any public 3D archaeology surface goes live — the proposed `ADR-<NNNN>-maplibre-sole-renderer-retire-cesium.md` is the controlling decision (OPEN-DR-10).

## 6. Click-resolution & Evidence Drawer contracts

A click on an archaeology feature does **not** read the rendered tile attributes as evidence. It produces a **governed lookup** that resolves to an `EvidenceDrawerPayload` or returns an `ABSTAIN` / `DENY` / `HOLD` with reasons.

### 6.1 Resolution flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    participant Map as MapLibre runtime
    participant API as Governed API
    participant Pol as PolicyDecision gate
    participant EV as EvidenceBundle resolver
    participant UI as Evidence Drawer

    User->>Map: click feature
    Map->>API: feature_id + layer_id + MapContextEnvelope
    API->>Pol: evaluate (rights · sensitivity · review · release)
    alt ANSWER permitted
        Pol->>EV: resolve EvidenceBundle projection
        EV-->>API: EvidenceDrawerPayload
        API-->>UI: RuntimeResponseEnvelope{ANSWER, payload, obligations}
    else ABSTAIN
        API-->>UI: RuntimeResponseEnvelope{ABSTAIN, abstain_reason}
    else DENY
        API-->>UI: RuntimeResponseEnvelope{DENY, deny_reason, alternative?}
    else HOLD
        API-->>UI: RuntimeResponseEnvelope{HOLD, review_pending_ref}
    else ERROR
        API-->>UI: RuntimeResponseEnvelope{ERROR, audit_ref}
    end
```

### 6.2 Required `EvidenceDrawerPayload` carry-over (Archaeology)

Every archaeology drawer payload MUST surface:

- `claim` — what the user is being shown, in plain language;
- `evidence_bundle_refs` and `evidence_ref_summaries`;
- `source_role` and source family (e.g., SHPO record, tribal / steward review, LiDAR candidate, oral-history record);
- `valid_time` window and `release_time`;
- `rights_status`, `sensitivity_tier` (T0–T4), `care_status`, sovereignty notice (if applicable);
- `review_state` (e.g., reviewed / pending / not-required) → resolves to `ReviewRecord`;
- `correction_state` and `supersedes` / `superseded_by` links;
- `transforms_applied` — list of `RedactionReceipt` / `PublicationTransformReceipt` IDs;
- `limitations` — uncertainty, candidate-vs-confirmed disclaimer where applicable.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Anti-pattern guard.** The Evidence Drawer is the **drawer**, not a badge. Badges link to drawer entries; they do not replace them. A click must resolve to a drawer payload **or** return `ABSTAIN` / `DENY` / `HOLD` — never silently produce uncited text. Source: operating contract §22.3 ("no popup as Evidence Drawer substitute"); Atlas §24.9.2.

## 7. Time-aware contracts

Archaeology layers are inherently temporal: cultural temporal periods, survey campaigns, candidate detections, and chronology assertions all carry distinct times that the UI MUST preserve and never collapse.

| Time field | Semantics | UI obligation |
|---|---|---|
| `source_time` | When the source asserted the fact | Surface in drawer; do **not** display as observed time |
| `observed_time` | When the field event occurred (excavation, survey, scan) | Drives temporal layer selection |
| `valid_time` | Window over which the claim is held to apply | Time slider scope |
| `retrieval_time` | When KFM fetched the source | Freshness inference |
| `release_time` | When the released artifact was published | Version-lock anchor |
| `correction_time` | When a correction or supersession applied | Stale / superseded badge |

**PROPOSED defaults (project-doctrine carryover):**

- Time slider state is **layer-scoped**; cross-domain joins MUST declare their time basis explicitly.
- A version-lock pins the released layer snapshot; the slider MUST NOT pull unreleased candidates (operating contract §22.3 — "no unreleased tile load").
- Cluster / heatmap layers for `CulturalTemporalPeriod` MUST be labeled as **generalized cultural activity zones**, not precise sites.

## 8. Focus Mode contracts (governed AI)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **CONFIRMED doctrine.** AI is interpretive, **never** the root truth source. For Archaeology, Focus Mode MAY **summarize released `EvidenceBundle`s, compare evidence, explain limitations, and draft steward-review notes.** It MUST `ABSTAIN` when evidence is insufficient and `DENY` where policy, rights, sensitivity, or release state blocks the request. Source: Atlas Ch. 15 §L; operating contract §42–§43 worked examples.

### 8.1 Required input (`FocusRequestEnvelope`)

- `question` — bounded scope; archaeology-relevant intent;
- `map_context_envelope` — visible layers, bounds, zoom, time window, selected features; **all archaeology layers must already be released and public-safe**;
- `policy_context` — user role, sensitivity tier, sovereignty constraints;
- `requested_evidence_depth` — drawer-level vs. compare-mode.

### 8.2 Required output (`FocusResponseEnvelope`)

- `outcome` ∈ { `ANSWER`, `ABSTAIN`, `DENY`, `ERROR`, optional `NARROWED`, `BOUNDED` };
- `answer` text (only if `ANSWER`), every claim cited;
- `citations` — resolvable `EvidenceRef`s only;
- `citation_validation_report_id` → `CitationValidationReport`;
- `abstain_reason` / `deny_reason` — typed enum (see [Appendix B](#19-appendix));
- `evidence_used` — list of `EvidenceBundle` refs;
- `policy_decisions` — applied gates and obligations;
- `ai_receipt_id` → `AIReceipt`.

### 8.3 Archaeology-specific obligations

- **Sovereignty-aware summaries.** Focus Mode MUST surface CARE labels and explain what evidence influenced the answer.
- **Generalization disclaimer.** Cluster / period summaries MUST explicitly state they describe **generalized cultural activity zones**, not exact sites.
- **Exact-location denial.** Any prompt soliciting precise coordinates for sensitive archaeology → `DENY` with reason `SENSITIVITY_EXACT_GEOMETRY` (enum name **PROPOSED**). Mirrors operating contract §43 worked example for burial-site coords.
- **Uncited claim guard.** A Focus Mode answer with any uncited assertion fails citation validation and MUST downgrade to `ABSTAIN`.
- **RAW / WORK access denial.** AI never reads `RAW` or `WORK` content; only released `EvidenceBundle`. Atlas §24.5.2 lists this as T4 by construction.

## 9. Sensitivity tiers, geometry, and CARE controls

### 9.1 Sensitivity tier mapping (canonical — Atlas v1.1 §24.5)

KFM publishes only the safest representation that still answers the steward's and the public's reasonable needs. Archaeology objects map to the canonical T0–T4 scheme as follows:

| Archaeology object class | Default tier | Allowed transforms (PROPOSED) | Required gates |
|---|---|---|---|
| Site location (`ArchaeologicalSite`) | **T4** | Steward review + cultural review + generalized geometry (coarse cell) + `RedactionReceipt` → T2 or T1 | `RedactionReceipt` + `ReviewRecord` + `PolicyDecision` |
| Human remains / sacred sites | **T4** | No transform releases this to T0; **T3 only under explicit named authorization** | Sovereignty review + `ReviewRecord` + `PolicyDecision` |
| `CulturalTemporalPeriod` (generalized chronology) | T0 | None required for the period concept itself | Standard Gates A–G |
| Survey coverage extent (`SurveyProject`, `SurveyTransect`) | T0 | None required for extent polygons | Standard Gates A–G |
| Candidate features (`RemoteSensingAnomaly`, `LiDARCandidate`, `GeophysicsObservation`) | **T1** | Geoprivacy generalization + `RedactionReceipt`; label retained as **candidate**, not site | `RedactionReceipt` + steward review |
| Artifact / collection records (`ArtifactRecord`, `CollectionRepositoryRecord`) | T1 / T2 | Strip collection-security exposure; aggregate where applicable | `RedactionReceipt`, optional `AggregationReceipt` |
| Oral-history / cultural-knowledge records | **T4** _(deny default)_ | Steward + sovereignty review → T2/T3 under named agreement | Sovereignty review + `ReviewRecord` + named-party agreement |
| Steward-only exact-geometry review surface | **T2** | None — review-class access | `ReviewRecord` + access log |
| 3D documentation (scene content) | **T2** _(or T1 with generalization)_ | Reality Boundary Note + `RepresentationReceipt` + generalization | Steward review + `RedactionReceipt` + `RepresentationReceipt` |

**Tier transition rule (Atlas §24.5.3, CONFIRMED reversibility doctrine):** Every tier promotion (T4 → T1, T2 → T1, T1 → T0) is **reversible**. Correction may demote a published T1 layer back to T4 via `CorrectionNotice` + `RollbackCard`.

### 9.2 Geometry generalization thresholds (PROPOSED defaults)

- **`generalization_floor`** = H3 resolution **r7** — any sensitive archaeology geometry below this is prohibited for public products. *(Source basis: project doctrine extracted from SRC-061.)*
- **`min_buffer_distance`** = **5 km** coordinate generalization when archaeological terrain is hosted in `packages/maplibre-runtime/` 3D surfaces. *(Source basis: ML-059-055.)*
- Every generalization is a **`SensitivityTransform` event** witnessed by a **`RedactionReceipt`** (and, when archaeology-specific, a **`PublicationTransformReceipt`**). The receipt ID is required in `LayerManifest.generalization_log_ref` and in `EvidenceDrawerPayload.transforms_applied[]`.

> [!CAUTION]
> Thresholds above are **PROPOSED defaults** carried from project sources. Final values are owned by the sensitivity policy bundle (`policy/sensitivity/archaeology/`) and **NEEDS VERIFICATION** against the live policy package. The thresholds are **floors**, not ceilings — review may require coarser generalization.

### 9.3 CARE labels and sovereignty notice

- **CARE status** (Collective benefit · Authority to control · Responsibility · Ethics) is a **required field** on every archaeology layer payload.
- **Sovereignty notice chips** appear in the UI when the layer or feature traces to a sovereign or steward-held source.
- **Cultural symbols.** Archaeological / cultural symbols MUST avoid sacred symbols or tribal insignia, remain WCAG-accessible, use generalized geometry, and carry CARE metadata.
- **Rights-holder representative** is a required separate reviewer beyond the domain steward (operating contract §23.2 row "Archaeology — site locations"; Atlas §24.7.1).

## 10. Trust-visible UI states

The UI MUST expose, **without substituting badges for evidence**, finite states that map to the underlying governance. State names align with the operating contract §22.2 UI negative-state enum.

| Visible state | Underlying enum (op-contract §22.2) | Trigger | Drawer behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| ✅ Verified | _(positive — ANSWER)_ | `EvidenceBundle` resolves; citations valid; release current | Show evidence + citations |
| ⏳ Pending review | _(HOLD)_ | `review_state = pending`; `ReviewRecord` open | Show drawer with "pending" notice; restrict export |
| ⚠ Stale | `SOURCE_STALE` | `release_time` past `stale_after` | Show drawer + stale chip; allow inspection |
| 🚫 Suppressed | `DENIED_BY_POLICY` | Sensitivity / rights deny public layer | Layer hidden; deny chip explains class, not content |
| 🌀 Generalized | `GENERALIZED_GEOMETRY` | `RedactionReceipt` applied | Generalization chip + transform-receipt link |
| 🔒 Restricted access | `RESTRICTED_ACCESS` | Access-class gate (steward / authorized party) | Layer not loaded in public client; explainer chip |
| 📭 Missing evidence | `MISSING_EVIDENCE` | `EvidenceBundle` not resolved | Drawer abstains; no claim emitted |
| ❌ Failed verification | `CITATION_FAILED` / `RUNTIME_ERROR` | Signature / digest / citation validation failed | No drawer payload; ERROR with diagnostic ref |
| 🔁 Conflict | `CONFLICTED_SUPPORT` | Two `EvidenceBundle`s disagree | Show both with conflict chip; do not pick a side |
| ↩ Withdrawn | `RELEASE_WITHDRAWN` | `RollbackCard` invalidated this release | Show withdrawal notice + correction link |
| 🕊 Sovereignty notice | _(badge layer)_ | CARE / tribal stewardship applies | Sovereignty chip + steward attribution |

**Accessibility requirement (CONFIRMED doctrine carryover).** Trust badges MUST be keyboard-navigable, screen-reader-readable, and pass contrast checks; badge state MUST be testable via fixture.

## 11. Finite outcomes & policy decisions

Every governed surface in this lane returns one of the outcomes from the canonical KFM vocabulary. There is no "silent success without evidence."

| Outcome | When it applies | Required carry-along |
|---|---|---|
| **`ANSWER`** | Evidence resolved · policy permits · release current | `EvidenceRef`s · citations · obligations |
| **`ABSTAIN`** | Evidence insufficient · scope undefined · uncited claim · evidence stale and no released alternative | `abstain_reason` enum · suggested next action · `AIReceipt` |
| **`DENY`** | Rights / sensitivity / sovereignty / release blocks the answer | `deny_reason` enum (e.g., `SENSITIVITY_EXACT_GEOMETRY`, `RIGHTS_UNKNOWN`, `REVIEW_NEEDED`) · `PolicyDecision` |
| **`ERROR`** | Schema / integrity / signature / system failure | `audit_ref` for diagnostic |
| **`HOLD`** | Promotion / correction paused pending steward, rights-holder, or policy review | `ReviewRecord` pending; surface remains in prior state |
| **`NARROWED`** _(optional)_ | Answer issued in a scope tighter than requested due to evidence or policy bounds | `RuntimeResponseEnvelope` extension |
| **`BOUNDED`** _(optional)_ | Answer issued with explicit confidence / coverage bounds | `RuntimeResponseEnvelope` extension |
| **`PASS`** _(validator-class)_ | Validator / admission check completed; input acceptable | `ValidationReport` PASS |
| **`FAIL`** _(validator-class)_ | Validator / admission check completed; input unacceptable | `ValidationReport` with failure list |

> [!NOTE]
> Reason enums are **PROPOSED** in this doc. The canonical enum vocabulary is owned by `schemas/contracts/v1/runtime/runtime_response_envelope.schema.json` and the policy bundle, and is **ADR-class** per Directory Rules §2.4(4) (vocabulary stability). The operating contract §8 names `RuntimeResponseEnvelope`; the Atlas (Pass-32 KFM-P5-PROG-0001) names `DecisionEnvelope` for the policy-output envelope — both are CONFIRMED and serve distinct purposes (see [§4](#4-contracts-inventory)).

## 12. Validation, tests, and fixtures

These validators / tests are **PROPOSED** in implementation form but **CONFIRMED** as required by project doctrine. Each MUST have both positive and negative fixtures.

| Validator / test | What it proves | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `EvidenceBundle`-required test (Archaeology) | No public archaeology feature reaches the drawer without an `EvidenceBundle` | **PROPOSED** |
| Candidate-not-site test | Candidate anomalies / clusters are never serialized or labeled as confirmed sites | **PROPOSED** |
| Public no-leak test (tile-binary) | Sensitive exact geometry does not appear in any public layer, **tile binary**, popup, or export — not just the styled view | **PROPOSED** |
| Rights & cultural-review test | Layers with unresolved rights or pending steward review fail closed (HOLD or DENY) | **PROPOSED** |
| Exact-sensitive-geometry denial | DENY outcome on prompts / queries soliciting precise coordinates for T3 / T4 objects | **PROPOSED** |
| Generalization-log presence | Every public archaeology layer manifest references a `RedactionReceipt` (and `PublicationTransformReceipt` where archaeology-specific) | **PROPOSED** |
| Catalog closure test | Released archaeology layers have catalog records, `EvidenceBundle`s, and rollback targets | **PROPOSED** |
| `MapReleaseManifest` closure | Every public archaeology layer set binds to a signed `MapReleaseManifest` with a resolvable `RollbackCard` target | **PROPOSED** |
| AI exact-location denial | Focus Mode DENYs precise-location prompts; ABSTAINs on insufficient evidence | **PROPOSED** |
| Citation validation | Every Focus Mode `ANSWER` passes `CitationValidationReport` | **PROPOSED** |
| Trust-badge a11y / state | Badges expose keyboard, contrast, and finite-state coverage | **PROPOSED** |
| Time-lock fixture | Time slider only loads released snapshots; missing-time and stale cases tested | **PROPOSED** |
| Rollback drill | Prior `MapReleaseManifest` restorable; cache keys invalidated; correction lineage intact | **PROPOSED** |
| Source-role anti-collapse | Survey / candidate / confirmed / aggregate roles never upcast in publication (Atlas §3 doctrine) | **PROPOSED** |
| No-network fixture | Synthetic archaeology candidate fixture: exact geometry denied, public generalized tile, steward review record, correction / rollback path | **PROPOSED** |
| 3D admission test _(if any 3D archaeology surface)_ | Every 3D-enabled layer passes the **3D Admission Decision** before terrain / globe / plugin layer construction; `RepresentationReceipt` emitted | **PROPOSED** |

## 13. Anti-patterns (must-not-do)

> [!WARNING]
> The following are **explicit failure modes** for this lane. Each MUST be detectable by fixture and denied or quarantined at the policy gate. Source: Atlas §24.9.2; operating contract §22.3.

- **Treating MapLibre / tiles as truth.** Renderer output is downstream; tiles simplify and carry selected attributes, not source authority.
- **Treating a candidate as a site.** LiDAR / remote-sensing / geophysics candidates are not confirmed sites — UI labels, popups, exports, and Focus Mode answers MUST preserve the distinction.
- **Hiding exact sensitive geometry with style filters.** Public bytes still expose exact geometry; generalize / redact **before** tile build. Style-only hiding is explicitly denied (operating contract §22.3).
- **Using a badge as the evidence surface.** Badges link to the Evidence Drawer; they do not stand in for it.
- **Popup as Evidence Drawer substitute.** A click MUST resolve through the governed API to a drawer payload (or `ABSTAIN` / `DENY` / `HOLD`); the popup never becomes the trust surface.
- **Uncited Focus Mode answer.** If a citation does not resolve, the answer downgrades to `ABSTAIN`.
- **Public route reading canonical store.** Map / UI clients reach archaeology data only through `apps/governed-api/`. No browser fetch of `data/raw/`, `data/work/`, or `data/quarantine/`.
- **3D as an alternate truth path.** Per v1.3 doctrine, `packages/maplibre-runtime/` is the **sole** renderer; it consumes the same evidence as 2D and never bypasses policy.
- **Direct renderer-library import in app code.** `apps/explorer-web/` (and any focus-mode app code) MUST NOT import `maplibre-gl`, `three`, `3d-tiles-renderer`, `deck.gl`, `maplibre-gl-lidar`, or `maplibre-three-plugin` directly — all access goes through `packages/maplibre-runtime/` (Directory Rules §7.2.a, §13.5 v1.3).
- **Generalization without a receipt.** Every generalization is a `RedactionReceipt` (and `PublicationTransformReceipt` where applicable) linked in the manifest and drawer.
- **Heatmap / cluster read as site locator.** Period clusters describe generalized cultural activity zones; the UI MUST say so plainly.
- **Aggregate cited as per-place observation.** Atlas §24.9.2 — source-role collapse violates matrix-cell semantics.
- **AI generation routed through admin shortcut.** Atlas §24.9.2 — admin bypass MUST NOT become a normal-path public route.
- **Release without `MapReleaseManifest` or rollback target.** Atlas §24.9.2 — public surfaces MUST be rollback-eligible.

## 14. Open questions register

| ID | Question | Owner role | Resolution path | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## 15. Open verification backlog

These items remain `NEEDS VERIFICATION` before promotion from `draft` → `published`:

1. Confirm `apps/governed-api/` route names for `archaeology/features`, `archaeology/layers/manifest`, `archaeology/evidence-drawer`, `archaeology/focus`. _(OQ-AR-01)_
2. Resolve schema-home conflict between Directory Rules §12 and Atlas §24.13; either an ADR or a drift entry MUST land. _(OQ-AR-02)_
3. Resolve policy-bundle home conflict between Atlas `policy/sensitivity/archaeology/` and Directory Rules §12 `policy/domains/archaeology/sensitivity/`. _(OQ-AR-03)_
4. Inspect `policy/sensitivity/archaeology/` for the active `generalization_floor` and `min_buffer_distance`; confirm or amend the H3 r7 / 5 km defaults. _(OQ-AR-04)_
5. Inspect `governance/` and CODEOWNERS for the sovereignty / cultural review workflow and named reviewer roles. _(OQ-AR-05)_
6. Confirm `RuntimeResponseEnvelope` reason-code enum entries listed in [Appendix B](#19-appendix) land in `schemas/contracts/v1/runtime/`. _(OQ-AR-07, OQ-AR-12)_
7. Confirm `tests/fixtures/` home for negative-case archaeology fixtures. _(OQ-AR-11)_
8. Run an end-to-end no-network fixture drill against an Ellsworth-area generalized site summary; archive the `RollbackCard`. _(OQ-AR-09)_
9. Confirm the Directory Rules §18.e OPEN-DR-10 ADR status; until accepted, 3D archaeology surfaces remain frozen. _(OQ-AR-06)_
10. Confirm `MapReleaseManifest`, `RedactionReceipt`, `PublicationTransformReceipt`, `ReviewRecord`, `RepresentationReceipt`, and `RollbackCard` schemas exist at the paths listed in [§4](#4-contracts-inventory).

## 16. Changelog v0.1 → v0.2

| Change | Type (per contract §37) | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Pinned `CONTRACT_VERSION = "3.0.0"` in meta block and badge row | housekeeping | Required by `ai-build-operating-contract.md` v3.0 authoring rules. |
| Replaced bespoke `ArchaeologyDecisionEnvelope` with `RuntimeResponseEnvelope` (Archaeology projection) | reconciliation | Aligns with operating contract §9.2 glossary; `DecisionEnvelope` retained as the policy-output object per Atlas §24.3 / KFM-P5-PROG-0001. Distinction surfaced in [§4](#4-contracts-inventory) and OQ-AR-12. |
| Added canonical sensitivity-tier mapping (T0–T4) in [§9.1](#9-sensitivity-tiers-geometry-and-care-controls) | gap closure | Atlas §24.5 is the canonical tier scheme; v0.1 used an ad-hoc class register. |
| Added `MapReleaseManifest`, `RedactionReceipt`, `PublicationTransformReceipt`, `ReviewRecord`, `CorrectionNotice`, `RollbackCard`, `DecisionEnvelope` to contracts inventory | gap closure | These are required carry-along artifacts per operating contract §23.2 and Atlas §24.2 / §24.5. |
| Reframed 3D handoff around `packages/maplibre-runtime/` as **sole renderer** | reconciliation | Directory Rules v1.3 retires `packages/cesium*` pending OPEN-DR-10; v0.1 still described a Cesium handoff. |
| Aligned UI state names to operating contract §22.2 enum (`MISSING_EVIDENCE`, `SOURCE_STALE`, `DENIED_BY_POLICY`, `GENERALIZED_GEOMETRY`, `RESTRICTED_ACCESS`, `CONFLICTED_SUPPORT`, `CITATION_FAILED`, `RELEASE_WITHDRAWN`, `RUNTIME_ERROR`) | clarification | v0.1 used informal state labels. |
| Expanded outcome vocabulary to include `HOLD`, `PASS`, `FAIL`, `NARROWED`, `BOUNDED` | clarification | Per operating contract §8 + Atlas §24.3.1. |
| Reformatted open questions as `OQ-AR-NN` register; added open verification backlog, changelog, definition of done | housekeeping | Doctrine doc companion sections per authoring prompt §`<doctrine_doc_companion_sections>`. |
| Path placement re-evaluated against Directory Rules §6.1 (CONFIRMED) and §12 (PROPOSED segment); CONFLICTED with Atlas §24.13 flagged at OQ-AR-02 | clarification | Truth-label discipline per `<truth_labels>`. |
| Added anti-patterns from Atlas §24.9.2 (aggregate-as-observation, admin bypass, release without rollback) and operating contract §22.3 (style-only hiding, popup-as-drawer) | gap closure | v0.1 listed only the most obvious failure modes. |

> **Backward compatibility.** Section heading anchors `#1` through `#13` are preserved. New anchors `#14` (re-numbered from v0.1 §14 "Open questions & verification backlog" which was a single combined section) through `#19` are added. The v0.1 combined section is split into [§14 Open questions](#14-open-questions-register) and [§15 Open verification backlog](#15-open-verification-backlog) — any external link to the old `#14-open-questions--verification-backlog` anchor will need updating. Flagged for the docs steward.
>
> **Version classification.** **MINOR** per contract §37 — clarifications, reconciliations, and gap closures; no breaking schema or doctrine-invariant changes.

## 17. Definition of done

This document is **done enough to enter the repository** when:

- it is placed at `docs/domains/archaeology/MAP_UI_CONTRACTS.md` per Directory Rules §6.1 / §12;
- the archaeology domain steward, map shell steward, governed AI surface steward, sensitivity reviewer, and rights-holder representative have reviewed it (separation-of-duties per Atlas §24.7);
- it is linked from `docs/domains/archaeology/README.md` and the doctrine index;
- it does not conflict with accepted ADRs (ADR-0001 schema home; **OPEN-DR-10** MapLibre sole renderer when accepted);
- the schema-home conflict (OQ-AR-02) and policy-bundle-home conflict (OQ-AR-03) are either resolved by ADR or logged in `docs/registers/DRIFT_REGISTER.md`;
- the `GENERATED_RECEIPT.json` planned in Section 2 of the authoring run is wired into CI;
- future changes follow `ai-build-operating-contract.md` §37 lifecycle.

## 19. Appendix

<details>
<summary><strong>A. Glossary (domain terms used here)</strong></summary>

| Term | Definition (project-grounded) |

| `SurveyProject` / `SurveyTransect` / `ShovelTest` / `TestUnit` | Survey-level records: extent, methodology, coverage. Survey coverage is public-safe; individual survey hits may not be. |
| `ArtifactRecord` / `CollectionRepositoryRecord` | A documented object, typically tied to a collection-repository record and a `ProvenienceContext`. |
| `ProvenienceContext` / `StratigraphicUnit` | Spatial / stratigraphic units; bind artifact-to-context. |
| `ExcavationUnit` | A defined excavation footprint with stratigraphy. |
| `RemoteSensingAnomaly` / `LiDARCandidate` / `GeophysicsObservation` / `CandidateFeature` | **Candidate** detections — not confirmed sites. T1 with generalization. |
| `ChronologyAssertion` | Time-bound interpretive assertions. |
| `CulturalReview` / `StewardReview` | Review-state records governing release. |
| `SensitivityTransform` | A receipt-bearing operation that generalized, suppressed, or redacted geometry / attributes prior to release. |
| `PublicationTransformReceipt` | Archaeology-specific record of any pre-publication transform (Atlas Ch. 15 §C). |
| `EvidenceBundle` | The truth-bearing evidence object that outranks generated language. |
| `EvidenceRef` | A pointer that MUST resolve to an `EvidenceBundle`. |
| `RuntimeResponseEnvelope` | The finite-outcome wrapper at runtime (op-contract §9.2). |
| `DecisionEnvelope` | The normalized policy-module output `{decision_id, outcome, policy_family, reasons[], obligations[], evaluated_at}` (Atlas §24.3, KFM-P5-PROG-0001). |
| `PolicyDecision` | Allow / deny / restrict / abstain decision record carried inside `RuntimeResponseEnvelope`. |
| `LayerManifest` | The versioned layer contract carrying provenance, release state, integrity references, and `sensitive_flag`. |
| `MapReleaseManifest` | The release-decision artifact required for archaeology public layers (op-contract §23.2). |
| `RedactionReceipt` | Receipt-of-record for the SensitivityTransform that took a T4-default object to a lower public-safe tier. |
| `ReviewRecord` | Steward / cultural / sovereignty review outcome. |
| `RollbackCard` | Rollback target / drill object; required for every published archaeology layer. |
| `RepresentationReceipt` | Subtype of `RenderReceipt`; required for any 3D-enabled archaeology layer hosted in `packages/maplibre-runtime/`. |
| `Reality Boundary Note` | Required marker on synthetic / modeled / 3D surfaces distinguishing them from observed reality. |
