# Archaeology · Release Index

> Single point of inspection for **released Archaeology artifacts**, **active release candidates**, **correction notices**, **rollback cards**, **override records**, **stale-state markers**, and **supersession lineage** — without exposing exact sensitive geometry.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This index is a **docs-plane navigator**, not a truth store. The authoritative release record for any entry below is the `ReleaseManifest` in `release/manifests/` (governed under [`directory-rules.md` §9.2](../../doctrine/directory-rules.md) and the release contract defined in [`PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md` §6](./PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md#6--release-manifest-contract)). This page **MUST NOT** contain exact site coordinates, burial / human-remains geometry, sacred-site locations, or any T3–T4 payload — those publish through transforms and review, not through the index.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Sensitive-domain lane — deny-by-default.** Archaeology objects default to **Tier T4 (Denied)** for exact site geometry, human remains, sacred sites, collection security, and looting-risk exposure. Adding a row to this index that points to a release violating that posture is itself a publication anti-pattern. The release plane decides; the index only mirrors what already PASSed Gate G.

## 1. Scope

**CONFIRMED doctrine / PROPOSED implementation.** This index aggregates **release-plane references** for the Archaeology domain so that reviewers, stewards, and the public-via-governed-API can answer four questions in one place:

- **What is currently released** under Archaeology, at what sensitivity tier, with which `release_id`?
- **What is in candidate review**, and which gates are still open?
- **What corrections** have been issued against previously released claims?
- **What rollback cards** are on file, and which prior release each rolls back to?

The doctrinal source for these objects is the **release plane** (`release/`) and the **published artifact plane** (`data/published/layers/archaeology/`), kept distinct under [`directory-rules.md` §9.2](../../doctrine/directory-rules.md). This page **explains** and **navigates**; it does not **decide**.

> [!NOTE]
> **Companion docs in the archaeology lane.** The decision content this index lags is partitioned across four sibling docs:
> - [`OBJECT_FAMILIES.md`](./OBJECT_FAMILIES.md) — identity-bearing archaeology objects.
> - [`PIPELINE.md`](./PIPELINE.md) — Pre-RAW → PUBLISHED lifecycle and Gates A–G.
> - [`PRESERVATION_MATRIX.md`](./PRESERVATION_MATRIX.md) — tier × transform decision matrix.
> - [`PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md`](./PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md) — governed API surfaces, OPA / Conftest deny rules, `ReleaseManifest` contract, separation-of-duties, correction / rollback / stale-state, audit indicators.
>
> When this index conflicts with any of those, **the sibling doc wins** because it is the doctrine surface; the index is the navigator.

## 2. Repo fit

**PROPOSED path.** This document lives at `docs/domains/archaeology/RELEASE_INDEX.md`, a docs-plane navigator paired with `docs/domains/archaeology/README.md`. The archaeology domain follows the **Domain Placement Law** ([`directory-rules.md` §12](../../doctrine/directory-rules.md)): a domain is a *segment* inside responsibility roots, never a root.

| Direction      | Repo neighbor (PROPOSED)                              | What flows                                                              |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Upstream**   | `docs/domains/archaeology/README.md`                  | Domain identity, scope, ubiquitous language, source families. |
| **Upstream**   | [`docs/domains/archaeology/OBJECT_FAMILIES.md`](./OBJECT_FAMILIES.md) | Identity-bearing archaeology objects; source-role anti-collapse register. |
| **Upstream**   | [`docs/domains/archaeology/PIPELINE.md`](./PIPELINE.md) | Pre-RAW → RAW → WORK / QUARANTINE → PROCESSED → CATALOG / TRIPLET → PUBLISHED; Gates A–G. |
| **Upstream**   | [`docs/domains/archaeology/PRESERVATION_MATRIX.md`](./PRESERVATION_MATRIX.md) | Tier × transform decision matrix and worked steward workflow. |
| **Upstream**   | [`docs/domains/archaeology/PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md`](./PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md) | Governed API surfaces; OPA deny rules; `ReleaseManifest` contract; separation of duties; correction / rollback / stale-state; override discipline; audit indicators. |
| **Upstream**   | `docs/doctrine/lifecycle-law.md`                      | RAW → … → PUBLISHED invariant. |
| **Upstream**   | `docs/doctrine/directory-rules.md` §9.2               | Release-plane vs. published-artifact-plane split. |
| **Sibling**    | `docs/domains/archaeology/SENSITIVITY.md` *(PROPOSED)* | Tier scheme, transforms, gates (detail catalogue). |
| **Downstream** | `release/manifests/`                                  | `ReleaseManifest` by `release_id` (authoritative). |
| **Downstream** | `release/candidates/archaeology/`                     | Release candidate dossiers (per [§12](../../doctrine/directory-rules.md)). |
| **Downstream** | `release/promotion_decisions/`                        | `PromotionDecision` records (Gates A–G). |
| **Downstream** | `release/correction_notices/`                         | `CorrectionNotice` records. |
| **Downstream** | `release/rollback_cards/`                             | `RollbackCard` records. |
| **Downstream** | `data/published/layers/archaeology/`                  | Released public-safe artifacts (PMTiles, STAC, etc.). |
| **Policy**     | `policy/domains/archaeology/`                         | Sensitivity, rights, review-required gates; default-deny OPA bundle. |
| **Register**   | `docs/registers/OVERRIDE_REGISTER.md` *(PROPOSED)*    | Signed override records (KFM-P3-IDEA-0003). |
| **Register**   | `docs/registers/DRIFT_REGISTER.md` *(PROPOSED)*       | Drift between this index and the release plane. |
| **Register**   | `docs/registers/VERIFICATION_BACKLOG.md` *(PROPOSED)* | Aging candidates and open verification items. |
| **Schema**     | `schemas/contracts/v1/release/`                       | Machine shape for release-plane objects (ADR-0001). |

> [!NOTE]
> **Repository is not mounted** in the drafting session. Every "Downstream" / "Register" path above is a **PROPOSED** target consistent with `directory-rules.md` §6, §9, and §12; the exact tree shape requires `NEEDS VERIFICATION` against a mounted repo and any superseding ADR.

## 3. What this index tracks

Each row in [§7](#7-released-layers-and-manifests)–[§10](#10-rollback-cards) is a **pointer** to a governed artifact, never the artifact itself.

- **Released layers** — public-safe map layers and catalog records currently published, keyed by `release_id`, `spec_hash`, and source role.
- **Release candidates** — dossiers under `release/candidates/archaeology/` that have not yet passed all promotion gates A–G ([`PIPELINE.md` §3](./PIPELINE.md#3--lifecycle-backbone)).
- **Correction notices** — `CorrectionNotice` records issued against any previously published archaeology release.
- **Rollback cards** — `RollbackCard` records targeting a prior safe release.
- **Sensitivity tier mapping** — the default tier for each archaeology object family and the allowed transforms before public release (canonical matrix in [`PRESERVATION_MATRIX.md` §4.2](./PRESERVATION_MATRIX.md#42-archaeology-object-class-tier-matrix-proposed)).
- **Override records** *(via* [`OVERRIDE_REGISTER.md`](#15-related-docs)*)* — signed override records that bypassed a non-blocking gate; never silent. _Source: KFM-P3-IDEA-0003; see [§16.G](#16--appendix--minimum-recorded-fields)._
- **Stale-state markers and supersession lineage** — surfaced where applicable; see [§16.E–F](#16--appendix--minimum-recorded-fields).

## 4. What this index does *not* contain

> [!WARNING]
> The index is a docs-plane surface and is read by public clients. **Sensitive payload never lives here.** Violations of this list are sensitivity-policy violations regardless of intent.

- **No exact site geometry** — including burial sites, human remains, sacred sites, looting-risk locations, or any geometry finer than the public-safe generalization threshold permitted by archaeology policy *(see [§11](#11-sensitivity-tier-mapping); current PROPOSED reference: H3 r7 per `[ML-061-159]` — `NEEDS VERIFICATION` against mounted policy; canonical threshold ADR is `OQ-ARCH-PIPE-03` / `OQ-ARCH-PM-03`)*.
- **No RAW / WORK / QUARANTINE references** — the index points only to `release/` and `data/published/` artifacts. Internal lifecycle stages are not surfaced.
- **No restricted-access archive identifiers** — collection security and private-landowner records remain T3 / T4.
- **No AI-generated narrative as truth** — Focus Mode summaries belong in the Evidence Drawer, never in this index. AI outputs are interpretive; `EvidenceBundle` outranks generated language.
- **No release manifests by value** — the index references `release_id` and links to `release/manifests/<release_id>.json`; it does not embed the manifest body.
- **No candidate framed as a confirmed site** — a `CandidateFeature`, `RemoteSensingAnomaly`, or `LiDARCandidate` listed in this index MUST carry its candidate role explicitly. Promotion is a **tier** transition, not a **source-role** upgrade ([`PRESERVATION_MATRIX.md` §11](./PRESERVATION_MATRIX.md#11--anti-collapse-and-source-role-preservation)).
- **No synthetic content framed as observation** — 3D scenes, reconstructions, and AI-drafted carriers MUST be labeled with `RealityBoundaryNote` and `RepresentationReceipt` references at the manifest layer; the index inherits those flags.

## 5. Directory tree (PROPOSED)

**PROPOSED neighbours of this file**, consistent with `directory-rules.md` §6, §9.2, and §12. Exact shape requires mounted-repo inspection.

> [!NOTE]
> The split between `data/published/` (released **artifacts**) and `release/` (release **decisions**) is one of the four named drift patterns in [`directory-rules.md` §13.2](../../doctrine/directory-rules.md). The index references both, but never inverts them.

> [!NOTE]
> Atlas v1.1 §2.1 row 15 names `policy/sensitivity/archaeology/`, `contracts/archaeology/`, and `schemas/contracts/v1/archaeology/` in flat form; Directory Rules §4 Step 3 illustrates `policy/domains/<domain>/` segmentation. This index follows the segmented form, consistent with the four sibling docs; the reconciliation is tracked as `OQ-ARCH-RI-01` (same question raised in sibling docs).

## 7. Released layers and manifests

**PROPOSED rows — placeholders until release plane is inspected.** Each row references one `ReleaseManifest` by `release_id`. No exact geometry. No source-secret identifiers. **Source role is shown so candidate / observed / aggregate are never silently conflated** (anti-collapse rule, [`PRESERVATION_MATRIX.md` §11](./PRESERVATION_MATRIX.md#11--anti-collapse-and-source-role-preservation)).

| `release_id` | Layer (public-safe name) | Source role | Sensitivity tier | `spec_hash` | Published at | Manifest | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `TBD-rel-arch-survey-coverage-YYYY-NNN`   | Survey coverage (generalized)             | aggregate  | T1 | `TBD` | `YYYY-MM-DD` | `release/manifests/TBD.json` *(PROPOSED)* | `NEEDS VERIFICATION` |
| `TBD-rel-arch-chronology-YYYY-NNN`        | Chronology / context view                 | context    | T1 | `TBD` | `YYYY-MM-DD` | `release/manifests/TBD.json` *(PROPOSED)* | `NEEDS VERIFICATION` |
| `TBD-rel-arch-candidate-anomaly-YYYY-NNN` | Candidate anomaly surface (generalized)   | **candidate** | T1 | `TBD` | `YYYY-MM-DD` | `release/manifests/TBD.json` *(PROPOSED)* | `NEEDS VERIFICATION` |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **No T3 / T4 row may carry a public link.** Reviewer-only entries (T2) and restricted entries (T3) appear in the steward console, not in this public index. T4 entries are listed by **count and existence only**, never by identity.

> [!WARNING]
> **A `candidate` row stays a candidate.** Releasing a `RemoteSensingAnomaly` / `LiDARCandidate` at T1 does not convert it to an `ArchaeologicalSite`. The Source role column above MUST be preserved across the row's lifetime and across any tier transition. _Source: Atlas v1.1 §24.1.1; [`PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md` §5.1 `deny.candidate_as_site`](./PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md#5--policy-as-code--deny--abstain--allow)._

<details>
<summary><strong>Reviewer / restricted summary (counts only)</strong></summary>

| Tier | Count | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| T2 — Reviewer   | `TBD` | Stewards / reviewers only. Resolves via governed API with auth context. |
| T3 — Restricted | `TBD` | Named-agreement gating; existence may be summarized, identity withheld. |
| T4 — Denied     | `TBD` | Existence may be summarized only with steward approval. |

</details>

## 8. Active release candidates

**PROPOSED rows.** Each row references a dossier in `release/candidates/archaeology/<candidate_id>/`. Promotion Gates A–G must all return `ANSWER` before promotion to `release/manifests/` ([`PIPELINE.md` §3](./PIPELINE.md#3--lifecycle-backbone); [`PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md` §7](./PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md#7--gate-g--release--review--rollback)).

| `candidate_id` | Proposed layer | Source role | Default tier | Open gates | Reviewer queue | Dossier |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## 9. Correction notices

**PROPOSED rows.** Corrections preserve the original release record; the corrected claim publishes through a **superseding release**, not by silent mutation. _Source: [`PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md` §9.1](./PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md#9--correction-and-rollback-discipline)._

| `notice_id` | Affected `release_id` | Defect class | Superseded by | Notice |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `TBD-corr-arch-NNN` | `TBD` | evidence · source-role · rights · sensitivity · geometry · temporal · policy · validation · rendering · API · AI-output | `TBD-rel-arch-NNN` | `release/correction_notices/TBD.json` *(PROPOSED)* |

> [!NOTE]
> The defect-class taxonomy is doctrine; the row above is a placeholder. See `Correction and rollback model` in the Unified Build Manual for full semantics, and [`PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md` §9](./PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md#9--correction-and-rollback-discipline) for the four-role separation-of-duties requirement (author / detector + correction reviewer + release authority; rights-holder representative when sensitivity-relevant).

## 10. Rollback cards

**PROPOSED rows.** Rollback restores a prior safe release; it is **never a hidden file copy**. _Source: [`PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md` §9.2](./PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md#9--correction-and-rollback-discipline)._

| `card_id` | From `release_id` | Rolled back to | Reason class | Card |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `TBD-rb-arch-NNN` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `release/rollback_cards/TBD.json` *(PROPOSED)* |

> [!CAUTION]
> **Rollback target is named in advance.** Every archaeology `ReleaseManifest` MUST name a reachable `rollback_target` at Gate G; an emergency-disablement runbook MUST exist and SHOULD be drilled periodically. _Source: Atlas v1.1 §15.N item 4; OQ-ARCH-PP-07._

## 11. Sensitivity tier mapping

**CONFIRMED doctrine / PROPOSED transform realization.** Default tiers for Archaeology object families. Transforms and gates must produce auditable receipts (`RedactionReceipt`, `AggregationReceipt`, `PublicationTransformReceipt` / `RepresentationReceipt`) and a `ReviewRecord` before the object is eligible for the lower tier.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This section is a navigator-level summary.** The canonical tier × transform decision matrix for archaeology — with every owning object family, all required receipts, the worked steward workflow, and the source-role anti-collapse rules — is in [`PRESERVATION_MATRIX.md` §4.2](./PRESERVATION_MATRIX.md#42-archaeology-object-class-tier-matrix-proposed) and [`PRESERVATION_MATRIX.md` §11](./PRESERVATION_MATRIX.md#11--anti-collapse-and-source-role-preservation). The table below MUST agree with that matrix; conflicts are logged in `docs/registers/DRIFT_REGISTER.md`.

| Object class                                 | Default tier | Allowed transforms (PROPOSED)                                                                | Required gates                                              |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Site location                                | **T4**       | Steward review + cultural review + generalized geometry (coarse H3 cell) + `RedactionReceipt` → T2 or T1. | `RedactionReceipt` + `ReviewRecord` + `PolicyDecision`. |
| Human remains / burials / sacred sites       | **T4**       | No transform releases to T0; T3 only under explicit named authorization.                     | Sovereignty review + `ReviewRecord` + `PolicyDecision`. |
| Excavation records / provenience packets     | **T3**       | Generalization + redaction → T2 under steward review.                                        | `RedactionReceipt` + `ReviewRecord` + `PolicyDecision`. |
| Collection / repository identifiers          | **T3**       | Identifier aliasing under steward agreement → T2; aggregate counts → T1.                     | `ReviewRecord` + `PolicyDecision`; collection-security review. |
| Candidate-feature (remote-sensing anomaly, LiDAR candidate, geophysics observation) | **T1** *(public-safe carrier only; role stays `candidate`)* | Generalized footprint (H3 r7 or coarser) + candidate-not-site labelling. | `AggregationReceipt` + `PolicyDecision` + candidate-not-site test. |
| Survey coverage summary                      | **T1**       | Aggregate / generalized public-safe layer.                                                   | `AggregationReceipt` + `PolicyDecision`. |
| Chronology / context view                    | **T0 – T1**  | Public-safe if no exact geometry leaks.                                                      | `PolicyDecision`. |
| `ThreeDDocumentation` (sensitive 3D scene)   | **T4**       | Generalization / clipping / `RepresentationReceipt` + `RealityBoundaryNote` → T2 / T1 with review. | Steward review + `RedactionReceipt` + `RepresentationReceipt`. |
| Oral history / cultural-knowledge records    | **T4**       | Steward + rights-holder consent → T3 named-party; public derivative only when consent is explicit. | Rights-holder representative + `ReviewRecord` + `PolicyDecision`. |
| Synthetic / reconstructed scene content      | **T4** until reviewed | Generalization + `RealityBoundaryNote` + `RepresentationReceipt` → T2 review-only; public surface only as labeled reconstruction. | `RealityBoundaryNote` + `RepresentationReceipt` + `ReviewRecord`. |
| AI summary (Focus Mode answer)               | **derived**  | Bounded by source tier of the underlying `EvidenceBundle`; AI must `ABSTAIN` if insufficient. | `AIReceipt` + `CitationValidationReport`. |

> [!CAUTION]
> The **H3 r7 floor** for sensitive archaeology products is sourced from the Master MapLibre v1.7 update packet (`[ML-061-159]`, EXTERNAL-INTERNAL reference within the KFM idea index). Treat this floor as **`NEEDS VERIFICATION`** against `policy/domains/archaeology/` until inspected on a mounted repo. The canonical archaeology generalization threshold is an open ADR item (`OQ-ARCH-RI-02`; mirrored in `OQ-ARCH-PIPE-03` / `OQ-ARCH-PM-03`).

> [!WARNING]
> **Tier transitions do not perform source-role upgrades.** Moving a `CandidateFeature` from T4 to T2 makes it visible to reviewers; it does not make it a confirmed `ArchaeologicalSite`. Role transitions are separate governed events with their own evidence and review. _Source: Atlas v1.1 §24.1; [`PRESERVATION_MATRIX.md` §11.1](./PRESERVATION_MATRIX.md#11--anti-collapse-and-source-role-preservation)._

## 12. Quickstart — add or update an entry

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This page is a **navigator**. Edits here do not promote, correct, or rollback anything. The release plane decides; this index records the pointer.

### Add a newly released layer (after `ANSWER` from Gates A–G)

1. Confirm a `ReleaseManifest` exists at `release/manifests/<release_id>.json` with `release_state: "PUBLISHED"`, valid `spec_hash`, `rollback.rollback_supported: true`, and a `contract_version` matching the current KFM `CONTRACT_VERSION`.
2. Confirm the released artifact is under `data/published/layers/archaeology/<release_id>/` and matches the manifest's `artifacts[].sha256`.
3. Confirm the layer's sensitivity tier and that no T3 / T4 payload is referenced from a public row.
4. Confirm separation of duties for the release was satisfied per [`PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md` §8](./PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md#8--separation-of-duties) — for any sensitive-lane archaeology release, author + sensitivity reviewer + release authority + rights-holder representative are all required.
5. Confirm `source_role` is set per record and is preserved from admission (no candidate → site silent upgrade).
6. Append a row to [§7](#7-released-layers-and-manifests). Reference the manifest path; do **not** inline its body.
7. Update the `updated` field in the meta block at the top of this file.

### Open a candidate row

```bash
# PROPOSED command shapes — exact tools depend on mounted repo
# 1) Create the candidate dossier under the canonical release plane
mkdir -p release/candidates/archaeology/<candidate_id>

# 2) Place the dossier (spec, evidence_refs, validation report, policy decision)
#    Do NOT publish to data/published/ at this stage.

# 3) Append a row to §8 of this index pointing to the dossier.
```

### Record a correction or rollback

1. Generate the `CorrectionNotice` *or* `RollbackCard` through the governed release flow — never by editing this file alone.
2. Confirm the artifact validates against `schemas/contracts/v1/release/correction_notice.schema.json` or `schemas/contracts/v1/release/rollback_card.schema.json`.
3. Confirm the four-role separation of duties for sensitive-lane corrections (see [`PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md` §8.2](./PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md#8--separation-of-duties)).
4. Append the row to [§9](#9-correction-notices) or [§10](#10-rollback-cards).

### Record an override (rare)

1. Generate the override record per [`PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md` §13](./PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md#13--override-and-emergency-bypass-discipline) — overrides are never silent.
2. The override MUST name the override actor, the gate bypassed, the rationale, the expected remediation, and the new release authority for the override-free re-release.
3. **Sensitivity / rights / sovereignty gates MUST NOT be overridden**, regardless of urgency.
4. Add a row to `docs/registers/OVERRIDE_REGISTER.md` and reference the override from the affected `ReleaseManifest`.

## 13. Governance and AI behavior

**CONFIRMED doctrine.** From the KFM Encyclopedia, Domains Atlas, and the sibling archaeology docs, applied to this index:

- The **trust membrane** governs every public read. Clients use the governed API (`apps/governed-api/`), not direct reads of `data/processed/` or `data/catalog/`. This index links to artifacts inside `data/published/` and `release/`, both of which are post-promotion. _See [`PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md` §3](./PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md#3--the-trust-membrane-for-archaeology)._
- **AI is interpretive.** Focus Mode may summarize released Archaeology `EvidenceBundle`s with `ANSWER / ABSTAIN / DENY / ERROR` outcomes and `AIReceipt` accountability. AI **must DENY** any request that would expose exact archaeological location, restricted personal data, or any T3 / T4 payload. Cluster surfaces are framed as **generalized cultural activity zones, not exact archaeological locations** (ML-061-163).
- **Cite-or-abstain** is the default truth posture for any claim sourced from this index. A row without a reachable `ReleaseManifest` is `UNKNOWN`, not `CONFIRMED`.
- **Promotion is a governed state transition**, not a file move. This index lags the release plane; it does not lead it.
- **Separation of duties** is non-optional for sensitive-lane archaeology release: author + sensitivity reviewer + release authority + rights-holder representative. _Source: Atlas v1.1 §24.7.2._
- **Overrides are first-class events.** Any release referenced in this index whose `ReleaseManifest` carries an `override_record_ref` MUST display an "override active" badge in any UI that resolves from this index, until remediation is recorded. _Source: KFM-P3-IDEA-0003._
- **Watcher is not publisher.** Watchers emit `EventEnvelope` + `EventRunReceipt` at Pre-RAW; they MAY NOT write to any other phase and MAY NOT cause an index row to appear directly.

## 14. FAQ

> [!NOTE]
> **Why isn't there a direct link to the artifact bytes?**
> The index references `release_id` and the `ReleaseManifest`. The artifact bytes resolve through the governed API and the manifest's `artifacts[].path` + `artifacts[].sha256`. Linking artifact bytes from a docs page would invite consumption without manifest checks.

> [!NOTE]
> **Why is exact site geometry not listed even at coarse resolution?**
> The default tier for archaeological site locations is **T4**. A coarse representation is releasable only after a `RedactionReceipt` + `ReviewRecord` + `PolicyDecision` produce a T1 candidate — and even then the index lists the **layer**, not the geometry.

> [!NOTE]
> **What if the index disagrees with the release plane?**
> The release plane wins. The index is a navigator and is subject to drift. Disagreements should be filed against `docs/registers/DRIFT_REGISTER.md` *(PROPOSED path)*.

> [!NOTE]
> **What if the index disagrees with a sibling archaeology doc?**
> The sibling doc wins. `OBJECT_FAMILIES.md`, `PIPELINE.md`, `PRESERVATION_MATRIX.md`, and `PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md` are the doctrine surface; the index is the navigator. Disagreements file against `docs/registers/DRIFT_REGISTER.md`.

> [!NOTE]
> **Why does a `candidate` row stay a candidate after release?**
> Releasing a generalized candidate surface at T1 changes the tier; it does NOT change the source role. A `RemoteSensingAnomaly` or `LiDARCandidate` remains a candidate until a separate, governed confirmation event (with its own evidence and review) reclassifies it. _Source: Atlas v1.1 §24.1; [`PRESERVATION_MATRIX.md` §11](./PRESERVATION_MATRIX.md#11--anti-collapse-and-source-role-preservation)._

> [!NOTE]
> **Is this page generated or hand-edited?**
> CURRENT: hand-edited. PROPOSED: rendered from `control_plane/release_state_register.yaml` filtered to `domain == "archaeology"` by a docs tool in `tools/docs/` *(PROPOSED — `NEEDS VERIFICATION`)*. Until then, append rows by hand using [§12](#12-quickstart--add-or-update-an-entry).

> [!NOTE]
> **Where do override records show up?**
> Overrides are recorded in `docs/registers/OVERRIDE_REGISTER.md` *(PROPOSED)* and referenced from the affected `ReleaseManifest` via `override_record_ref`. Any row in §7 whose underlying release is currently under an active override should be flagged with an "override active" badge.

## 16. Appendix — minimum recorded fields

<details>
<summary><strong>A. <code>ReleaseManifest</code> fields required to qualify for a §7 row</strong></summary>

Per the schema in `schemas/contracts/v1/release/release_manifest.schema.json` *(PROPOSED canonical home, ADR-0001)*. The full 20-field `ReleaseManifest` contract for archaeology is defined in [`PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md` §6](./PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md#6--release-manifest-contract); the minimum fields required for a §7 index row are:

- `object_type: "ReleaseManifest"`
- `schema_version: "v1"`
- `release_id`
- `created` *(date-time)*
- `spec_hash`
- `release_state: "PUBLISHED"` *(for §7)*
- `contract_version` — KFM `CONTRACT_VERSION` under which the release was produced.
- `policy_label`
- `rights_status`
- `sensitivity`
- `source_role_summary` — per-record source-role distribution; preserves anti-collapse posture.
- `artifacts[].{artifact_id, kind, path, sha256, blake3?}`
- `evidence_refs[]`
- `rollback.{rollback_supported, previous_release, rollback_plan_ref?}`
- `override_record_ref` — present only when an override is active (rare).

The index row carries only: `release_id`, public-safe layer name, **source role**, sensitivity tier, `spec_hash`, `created`, and a link to the manifest path. The remaining fields stay inside the manifest where they belong.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>B. <code>PromotionDecision</code> outcomes (Gates A–G)</strong></summary>

A candidate enters §7 only when the `PromotionDecision` for its `release_id` records `outcome: "ANSWER"` across all required gates. There are **two compatible gate framings** in the KFM corpus:

| Framing | Source | Gate set |
|---|---|---|
| **Atlas v1.1 §24.6 — Gates A–G (canonical doctrine).** | Atlas v1.1 §24.6.1; [`PIPELINE.md` §3](./PIPELINE.md#3--lifecycle-backbone). | **A.** Admission (Source identity) · **B.** Rights and terms · **C.** Sensitivity · **D.** Schema / contract · **E.** Evidence closure · **F.** Catalog / provenance · **G.** Review / release / rollback. |
| **Components Pass 10 C5-01 seven-gate matrix.** | KFM Components Pass 10 §C5-01. | Identity & Integrity · License & Provenance · Schema / Policy · Attestation · Steward Approval · Integration Smoke · Publish Ledger. |

> [!NOTE]
> The two framings are similar but not identical: the Atlas framing covers Admission → Release as a strictly governed sequence; the Pass 10 framing is the merge-readiness matrix used by CI required-checks branch protection. Reconciliation is an open ADR (`OQ-ARCH-RI-03`).

Any outcome other than `ANSWER` — `ABSTAIN`, `DENY`, `ERROR` — keeps the row in §8 or moves it to §9 / §10. *(PROPOSED implementation; CONFIRMED doctrine.)*

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>C. <code>CorrectionNotice</code> and <code>RollbackCard</code> minimum fields</strong></summary>

- `CorrectionNotice`: `notice_id`, `affected_release_manifest_path`, `defect_class`, `superseded_by`, `created_utc`, `status`, `policy_posture`, `review_records[]`, `derivative_invalidation_list[]`.
- `RollbackCard`: `card_id`, `release_id` (from), `rollback_to`, `reason`, `invalidates[]`, `review_ref`, `time`, `cache_keys[]`.

Field names follow the contract names in the Encyclopedia §App. E and the Unified Build Manual §Correction-and-rollback, refined in [`PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md` §9](./PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md#9--correction-and-rollback-discipline). **PROPOSED** until schemas at `schemas/contracts/v1/release/` are inspected.

<summary><strong>E. Stale-state markers (when a published row goes stale, not wrong)</strong></summary>

A PUBLISHED archaeology row in §7 may become **stale** long before it is **wrong**. KFM separates the two; both have visible markers. A stale row remains in §7 but carries a stale-state badge until its dependency is resolved.

| Marker | Trigger | UI signal in this index | Required action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Source freshness expired | Cadence in `SourceDescriptor` passed without re-admission. | Stale source badge. | Re-admit or supersede; otherwise mark dependent claims stale. |
| Schema version drift | Object schema upgraded past the published claim's schema version. | Schema-drift badge. | Migrate, re-validate, re-release; or mark stale. |
| Geography version drift | `GeographyVersion` replaced; the published claim is still bound to the prior version. | Geography-version banner. | Rebind to current `GeographyVersion`; re-release; or mark stale. |
| Time-scope outside support | Claim's temporal scope falls outside current data support window. | Time-out-of-support indicator. | Mark stale; do not refresh silently. |
| Model version superseded | `ModelRunReceipt` references an older model than current. | Model-version badge. | Re-run; supersede; or mark stale. |
| Review aged out | `ReviewRecord` older than the review-cycle tolerance for the archaeology sensitive lane. | Review-aged badge. | Trigger steward review; potentially downgrade tier. |
| Rights status changed | Rights change in `SourceDescriptor` or rights-holder communication. | Rights-changed badge. | Re-evaluate tier; potentially downgrade; emit `CorrectionNotice` if necessary. |
| Policy version changed | Archaeology policy bundle referenced by `PolicyDecision` was superseded. | Policy-version badge. | Re-run gate; potentially supersede release. |

<summary><strong>G. Reviewer roles required for archaeology releases referenced from §7–§10</strong></summary>

For a row to appear in §7 (PUBLISHED), the underlying release manifest MUST carry resolvable `review_records[]` for the roles below. Sensitive-lane releases (the archaeology default) require **all four** of source steward / sensitivity reviewer / release authority / rights-holder representative.

| Role | Scope in archaeology |
|---|---|
| Source steward | Admission of archaeology source families; rights confirmation; initial sensitivity tag. |
| Domain steward (archaeology) | Object meaning, contracts, validators; review of domain-internal promotions. |
| Sensitivity reviewer | Redaction, generalization, withholding, tier decisions for archaeology. |
| Rights-holder representative | Sovereignty, cultural-heritage, or consent-based release decisions; **mandatory** for oral history, sacred sites, human remains, and any T3 named-agreement path. |
| Release authority | Issues `ReleaseManifest`; authorizes the `PUBLISHED` transition; **distinct from authorship**. |
| Correction reviewer | Reviews `CorrectionNotice` and `RollbackCard` before they amend any published archaeology claim. |
| AI surface steward | Reviews Focus Mode templates, `AIReceipt` samples, archaeology policy bindings. |
| Docs steward | Owns this index, the four sibling docs, the ADR index, the drift register. |

<summary><strong>H. Override record — minimum fields (KFM-P3-IDEA-0003)</strong></summary>

When an override is recorded in `docs/registers/OVERRIDE_REGISTER.md` and referenced from a `ReleaseManifest`, the record MUST carry at minimum:

- `override_id`
- `override_actor` — named individual + signing identity.
- `gate_bypassed` — exact Gate A–G letter (or seven-gate name) bypassed; **sensitivity / rights / sovereignty gates MUST NOT be overridden**.
- `rationale` — written justification.
- `scope` — affected `release_id`(s) and `LayerManifest`(s).

<summary><strong>I. Index consistency rules (drift detection)</strong></summary>

A nightly (PROPOSED) consistency check verifies:

1. Every §7 row points to a `ReleaseManifest` whose `release_state == "PUBLISHED"`.
2. Every §7 row's `spec_hash` is unchanged since last successful index render.
3. Every §7 row's `source_role` matches the `source_role_summary` in its `ReleaseManifest`.
4. Every §8 row points to a dossier whose `PromotionDecision` is still open (no `ANSWER` recorded).
5. Every §9 row points to a `CorrectionNotice` whose `superseded_by` resolves.
6. Every §10 row's `rollback_to` resolves to a reachable prior release.
7. No T3 / T4 row carries a public link.
8. No row points to an artifact under `data/raw/`, `data/work/`, `data/quarantine/`, `data/processed/`, or `data/catalog/`.
9. Any row whose underlying release carries `override_record_ref` is flagged "override active."
10. Any divergence between this index and the four sibling archaeology docs is filed in `docs/registers/DRIFT_REGISTER.md`.

Failures of any of the above are reported as drift; this index does **not** silently self-heal.

## Open questions register

| ID | Question | Owner role | Resolution path |
|---|---|---|---|
| `OQ-ARCH-RI-01` | Does the archaeology lane use flat `policy/sensitivity/archaeology/` segments (per Atlas v1.1 §2.1 row 15) or `policy/domains/archaeology/` segments (per Directory Rules §4 Step 3)? Same question tracked in all four sibling docs (`OQ-ARCH-OF-01`, `OQ-ARCH-PIPE-01`, `OQ-ARCH-PM-07`, `OQ-ARCH-PP-01`). | Directory Rules owner + docs steward | ADR — reconcile §2.1 row 15 with §4 Step 3. |
| `OQ-ARCH-RI-02` | What is the **canonical archaeology generalization threshold** (the current PROPOSED H3 r7 floor) and where is it recorded? Mirrors `OQ-ARCH-PIPE-03` and `OQ-ARCH-PM-03`. | Domain steward + spatial-foundation steward | ADR; populate `policy/domains/archaeology/thresholds.json`. |
| `OQ-ARCH-RI-03` | How do the **Atlas v1.1 Gates A–G** (§16.B) reconcile with the **Components Pass 10 C5-01 seven-gate matrix**? Is one the canonical CI-side framing and the other the lifecycle / governance framing, or do they describe the same checks? | Release authority + docs steward | ADR — pair the two framings; pin which gate-letter set is authoritative for which surface. |
| `OQ-ARCH-RI-04` | Is the index page **hand-edited** indefinitely, or **rendered** from `control_plane/release_state_register.yaml` by a tool in `tools/docs/`? | Docs steward + release authority | Author the renderer; pin a render cadence; add a generated-from header when wired. |
| `OQ-ARCH-RI-05` | What is the **drift-check cadence** (nightly, on-PR, on-release)? See appendix §16.I. | CI owner + docs steward | Author CI workflow; record cadence in `docs/runbooks/archaeology/`. |
| `OQ-ARCH-RI-06` | What is the **SLA after which an aging candidate row in §8 is auto-flagged to `docs/registers/VERIFICATION_BACKLOG.md`**? | Release authority + docs steward | Pin SLA in `policy/domains/archaeology/thresholds.json`; add a candidate-age check to the drift workflow. |
| `OQ-ARCH-RI-07` | Should the index carry an **"override active"** badge per affected layer, or only at the row level, or both? | Docs steward + AI surface steward | UI lint rule + badge schema; document in [`PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md` §13](./PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md#13--override-and-emergency-bypass-discipline). |
| `OQ-ARCH-RI-08` | What is the **canonical home for `OverrideRecord` schema** — `schemas/contracts/v1/release/override_record.schema.json` (alongside other release-class schemas) or a separate `schemas/contracts/v1/override/`? Pair with ADR-S-03 receipt-class home. | Schema-home owner + release authority | ADR. |

## Open verification backlog

These items remain `NEEDS VERIFICATION` before promotion from `draft` to `published`:

1. Mounted-repo inspection of `release/manifests/`, `release/candidates/archaeology/`, `release/promotion_decisions/`, `release/correction_notices/`, `release/rollback_cards/`, `release/override_records/` (PROPOSED).
2. Mounted-repo inspection of `data/published/layers/archaeology/`.
3. Confirmation that the four sibling archaeology docs land at the same `docs/domains/archaeology/` segment as this file.
4. Confirmation of CODEOWNERS / `control_plane/source_authority_register.yaml` for the eight reviewer roles in §16.G.
5. Confirmation of the canonical generalization threshold (`OQ-ARCH-RI-02`).
6. Confirmation of the Gate A–G vs seven-gate framing reconciliation (`OQ-ARCH-RI-03`).
7. Confirmation that watchers cannot publish — `EventEnvelope` / `EventRunReceipt` implementation and no-publish tests aligned with [`PIPELINE.md` §5](./PIPELINE.md#5--pre-raw--watcher-signal-stage).
8. Confirmation that the drift-check workflow in §16.I is implemented in CI.
9. Confirmation that `docs/registers/OVERRIDE_REGISTER.md`, `docs/registers/DRIFT_REGISTER.md`, and `docs/registers/VERIFICATION_BACKLOG.md` exist (or are authored alongside this file).
10. Wiring of the planned `GENERATED_RECEIPT.json` (see PR notes) into CI before merge.
11. Cross-document consistency review between this index and the four sibling docs for shared object classes, gates, transforms, tiers, deny rules, review roles, and reason codes.

## Changelog v1 → v2

| Change | Type (per contract §37) | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Pinned `CONTRACT_VERSION = "3.0.0"` in meta block, badge row, title strip, footer, and Quickstart §12 step 1. | clarification | Doctrine-adjacent docs MUST pin the contract version. |
| Bumped `version: v1 → v2`; `updated: 2026-05-15 → 2026-05-28`. | housekeeping | Standard meta-block bump per contract §37 minor lifecycle. |
| Expanded `owners` from three roles (docs steward + archaeology domain owner + release steward) to six (docs steward + archaeology domain steward + sensitivity reviewer + release authority + correction reviewer + AI surface steward). | clarification | Aligns with Atlas v1.1 §24.7.1 reviewer-role register and [`PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md` §8.1](./PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md#8--separation-of-duties); rights-holder representative is added as a release-time requirement in §16.G rather than as a permanent doc owner. |
| Expanded `related:` list to include the four sibling archaeology docs (`OBJECT_FAMILIES.md`, `PIPELINE.md`, `PRESERVATION_MATRIX.md`, `PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md`), three registers (`DRIFT_REGISTER.md`, `OVERRIDE_REGISTER.md`, `VERIFICATION_BACKLOG.md`), and runbooks. | clarification | Companion-set cross-references; the archaeology lane is now five docs strong. |
| Added `> [!CAUTION]` sensitive-domain banner under the IMPORTANT callout at the top. | clarification | Aligns with sibling-doc top-banner pattern; reinforces deny-by-default before any row is read. |
| §1 Scope — added "Companion docs in the archaeology lane" callout pointing to the four sibling docs. | clarification | Establishes the doctrine-vs-navigator separation up front. |
| §2 Repo fit — added five new Upstream rows (`OBJECT_FAMILIES.md`, `PIPELINE.md`, `PRESERVATION_MATRIX.md`, `PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md`, `lifecycle-law.md`), one new Downstream row family (registers), and the override register. | gap closure | Reflects the now-authored sibling docs and the override-register requirement (KFM-P3-IDEA-0003). |
| §3 What this index tracks — added override-records and stale-state / supersession bullets. | gap closure | Surfaces the new §16.E–H appendix material and the override-as-first-class-event rule. |
| §4 What this index does NOT contain — added anti-collapse bullets: no candidate-framed-as-confirmed-site, no synthetic-framed-as-observation. | gap closure | Aligns with [`PRESERVATION_MATRIX.md` §11](./PRESERVATION_MATRIX.md#11--anti-collapse-and-source-role-preservation) and [`PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md` §5.1](./PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md#5--policy-as-code--deny--abstain--allow). |
| §5 Directory tree — added the four archaeology sibling files, the three registers, `policy/domains/archaeology/` policy-bundle layout, `release/override_records/`, and `override_record.schema.json`. | gap closure | Reflects the now-authored sibling docs and the override-register / policy-bundle expansion. |
| §6 Release plane diagram — added **Pre-RAW** node (with `EventEnvelope` / `EventRunReceipt`), added **override_records** node with attachment edges to `PromotionDecision` and `ReleaseManifest`, and added the override-records pointer from `TR`. | gap closure | Aligns with [`PIPELINE.md` §5](./PIPELINE.md#5--pre-raw--watcher-signal-stage) Pre-RAW recognition and the override-record discipline in [`PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md` §13](./PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md#13--override-and-emergency-bypass-discipline). |
| §7 Released layers and manifests — added **Source role** column to the row schema and a `WARNING` callout enforcing the anti-collapse rule (candidate stays a candidate across tier transitions). | gap closure | Anti-collapse is one of the highest-risk failure modes in archaeology; making `source_role` a visible column in the navigator prevents silent role upgrades. |
| §8 Active release candidates — added **Source role** and **Default tier** columns; added cross-ref to Gate G closure conditions in [`PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md` §7](./PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md#7--gate-g--release--review--rollback). | gap closure | Same anti-collapse motivation as §7; ties the candidate row to the canonical Gate G failure-mode catalog. |
| §9 / §10 — added cross-refs to [`PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md` §9](./PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md#9--correction-and-rollback-discipline). | clarification | The defect-class taxonomy and four-role separation-of-duties rule live in the publication doc, not in the navigator. |
| §10 — added emergency-rollback `> [!CAUTION]` callout. | clarification | Aligns with Atlas v1.1 §15.N item 4 and `OQ-ARCH-RI-04`. |
| §11 Sensitivity tier mapping — added rows for `ThreeDDocumentation`, oral history / cultural-knowledge, and synthetic / reconstructed scene content; added `> [!IMPORTANT]` callout naming [`PRESERVATION_MATRIX.md` §4.2](./PRESERVATION_MATRIX.md#42-archaeology-object-class-tier-matrix-proposed) as the canonical matrix; added `> [!WARNING]` callout reinforcing that tier transitions do not perform source-role upgrades. | gap closure | Brings the navigator's tier table into structural agreement with the canonical matrix in `PRESERVATION_MATRIX.md` v0.2. |
| §12 Quickstart — added a **separation-of-duties** check, a **source-role preservation** check, a **`contract_version` match** check, and a new **"Record an override (rare)"** subsection. | gap closure | Reflects the four-role release rule and the override-as-first-class-event discipline. |
| §13 Governance and AI behavior — added separation-of-duties, override-as-first-class-event, and watcher-as-non-publisher bullets, each cross-linked to the corresponding section in [`PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md`](./PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md). | gap closure | Brings the navigator's governance summary into parity with the publication doc. |
| §14 FAQ — added two new Q&As (sibling-doc precedence over the index; `candidate`-stays-`candidate` after release). | gap closure | Common navigator-pattern questions surfaced by the new sibling docs. |
| §15 Related docs — added entries for the four sibling docs, the three registers, runbooks, and `ai-build-operating-contract.md`. | clarification | Reflects the now-authored sibling set. |
| §16 Appendix — added subsections **E. Stale-state markers**, **F. Supersession lineage**, **G. Reviewer roles required for archaeology releases**, **H. Override record minimum fields**, and **I. Index consistency rules (drift detection)**. | gap closure | Brings the navigator's appendix into structural agreement with the publication doc and adds drift-detection rules that the navigator itself depends on. The existing A / B / C / D anchors are preserved. |
| §16.A — added `contract_version`, `source_role_summary`, and `override_record_ref` to the minimum-recorded-fields list. | clarification | Reflects the 20-field `ReleaseManifest` contract in [`PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md` §6](./PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md#6--release-manifest-contract). |
| §16.B — added the **two-framing reconciliation** (Atlas v1.1 §24.6 Gates A–G vs Components Pass 10 seven-gate matrix) and a NEEDS-VERIFICATION callout linking to `OQ-ARCH-RI-03`. | gap closure | The original v1 used "Gates A–G" but listed the Pass 10 seven-gate set verbatim — these are two real framings, not synonyms; flagging the drift is more honest than papering over it. |
| §16.C — added `review_records[]`, `derivative_invalidation_list[]`, and `cache_keys[]` to the minimum-fields lists. | clarification | Reflects the correction / rollback discipline in [`PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md` §9](./PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md#9--correction-and-rollback-discipline). |
| New companion sections — **Open questions register** (8 IDs `OQ-ARCH-RI-01..08`), **Open verification backlog** (11 numbered items), **Changelog**, **Definition of done**. | clarification | Aligns with the doctrine-adjacent companion-section pattern adopted in the four sibling docs. |
| Refreshed badge row: added `version: v2`, `CONTRACT_VERSION`, `watcher: non-publisher`; updated `last updated`. | housekeeping | Reflects new content; no doctrine change. |

> **Backward compatibility.** All §1–§16 anchors are preserved exactly. New material is added either inside existing sections (§§1–14 strengthened in place; §16 gains subsections E–I under the existing `#16-appendix--minimum-recorded-fields` anchor) or as **unnumbered** companion sections after §16 (Open questions register, Open verification backlog, Changelog, Definition of done). No previously-published anchor in this file is retired or renamed.

## Definition of done

This document is done enough to enter the repository when:

- it is placed at `docs/domains/archaeology/RELEASE_INDEX.md` per Directory Rules §4 Step 3 and Atlas v1.1 §2.1 row 15;
- archaeology domain steward, sensitivity reviewer, release authority, correction reviewer, AI surface steward, and docs steward have reviewed it;
- a sovereignty / cultural-authority reviewer has been notified for sign-off (sensitive domain);
- it is linked from `docs/domains/archaeology/README.md` (PROPOSED) and from a release-plane or doctrine index under `docs/doctrine/` or `control_plane/`;
- it is consistent with the four sibling archaeology docs ([`OBJECT_FAMILIES.md`](./OBJECT_FAMILIES.md), [`PIPELINE.md`](./PIPELINE.md), [`PRESERVATION_MATRIX.md`](./PRESERVATION_MATRIX.md), [`PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md`](./PUBLICATION_AND_POLICY.md)) for shared object classes, gates, transforms, tiers, deny rules, and review roles;
- it does not conflict with accepted ADRs (specifically ADR-0001 schema canonicality, Atlas v1.1 §24.12 ADR-S-01 schema home, ADR-S-03 receipt class home, ADR-S-05 tier scheme);
- any conflict with current repo conventions is logged in `docs/registers/DRIFT_REGISTER.md`;
- the planned drift-check workflow described in §16.I is wired into CI;
- the planned `GENERATED_RECEIPT.json` is wired into CI;
- future changes follow the operating contract's §37 lifecycle.
