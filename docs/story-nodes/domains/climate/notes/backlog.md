# 🌦️ **Climate Story Node Backlog (KFM v11)**  
### *Draft Climate Events · Regional Anomalies · Model/Observation Notes*  

`docs/story-nodes/domains/climate/notes/backlog.md`

**Purpose**  
Act as a **staging area** for draft climate Story Node ideas,  
preliminary data notes, model-run assessments, and backlog items  
awaiting refinement and conversion into full Story Nodes.

</div>

---

## 📘 Usage Notes

This backlog is for **non-final**, **generalized**, scientifically cautious content.  
It should not include:

- personal data  
- unsupported climate claims  
- precise impact estimates  
- media lacking license validation  
- unpublished proprietary model configurations  

Everything here is subject to domain + governance review.

## 🗂️ Backlog Items

A standardized backlog table for climate-related Story Node candidates.

| ID (Tentative) | Title / Topic | Status | Notes | Next Action |
|----------------|----------------|--------|--------|--------------|
| CLM-001 | 2022 Kansas Heatwave | draft | Need ERA5 anomaly extraction + STAC asset links | Build JSON Node |
| CLM-002 | 2011 Drought Progression (Kansas) | outline | Requires soil moisture + precipitation composites | Gather datasets |
| CLM-003 | Central Plains Tornado Outbreak (Generalized) | draft | Requires HRRR + NEXRAD blended maps | Create narrative sections |
| CLM-004 | 2024 Spring Wind Episode | draft | Needs synoptic-scale context from GFS | Add uncertainty notes |
| CLM-005 | Kansas Cold Spell (Arctic Outbreak) | concept | Requires temporal precision decision (hour/day) | Derive interval |
| CLM-006 | June 2008 Rainfall Extremes | outline | Good NOAA data coverage | Prepare summary + relations |
| CLM-007 | Smoke Intrusion Event (Canadian Fires) | research | Safe to publish; air-quality domain crossover | Assemble AQI/PM2.5 datasets |
| CLM-008 | Persistent Drought ANOM (multi-month) | research | Requires SPI + SPEI metrics | Determine mapping region |
| CLM-009 | Regional Blocking Pattern (Summer) | outline | More interpretation than observation | Detail synoptic setup |
| CLM-010 | Historical Analog: 1936 Heatwave | research | Public domain | Gather reanalysis approximations |

Add new backlog entries using the same column structure.

## 📝 Draft Notes Area

Use this section for:

- quick notes  
- dataset checks  
- anomaly calculations  
- temporal/spatial precision decisions  
- climate index notes (ENSO, PDO, NAO)  
- reviewer questions  

Only generalized, science-grounded notes are allowed.

---

## ⚖ Ethics & Attribution Reminders

Climate Story Nodes must:

- avoid overstating climate-attribution confidence  
- distinguish model output vs observations  
- use correct CF units and variable names  
- represent environmental impacts without sensationalism  
- include uncertainty wording for extremes  
- avoid political framing
