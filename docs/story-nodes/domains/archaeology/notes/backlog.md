# 🏺 **Archaeology Story Node Backlog (KFM v11)**  
### *Draft Concepts · Pending Reviews · Preliminary Notes*  

`docs/story-nodes/domains/archaeology/notes/backlog.md`

**Purpose**  
Maintain a curated list of **draft Story Node concepts**,  
awaiting review, generalization, consultation, or conversion  
to final Markdown/JSON Story Nodes.

</div>

## 📘 Usage Notes

This backlog is a **staging area**, not a public directory.  
Everything here is:

- **non-final**
- **generalized**
- **subject to sovereignty & CARE review**
- **subject to archaeology board approval**
- **not guaranteed to become a Story Node**

No sensitive content may appear here—**even drafts must follow masking rules**.

## 🗂️ Backlog Items

Below is the structured backlog table used across KFM v11 archaeology workflow.

| ID (Tentative) | Title / Topic | Status | Notes | Next Action |
|----------------|--------------|--------|--------|--------------|
| TBD-001 | Generalized Protohistoric Camp near Smoky Hill | draft | Needs sovereignty review + H3 masking level decision | Prepare v11 JSON Node |
| TBD-002 | Arkansas River Corridor Survey (Composite) | outline | Several survey seasons; requires generalization + merging | Define timeline window |
| TBD-003 | Walnut Basin Lithic Scatter | draft | Very sparse surface finds; requires uncertainty framing | Write narrative sections |
| TBD-004 | Fort Larned Peripheral Geophysics | draft | Non-invasive; safe to publish after masking | Add STAC assets |
| TBD-005 | Multi-phase Central Plains Village (Generalized) | concept | Needs occupation-phase splitting | Plan 2–3 Story Node phases |
| TBD-006 | 1930s WPA Excavation Archive (Generalized) | outline | Must avoid internal form details | Link only published scans |
| TBD-007 | Post-contact Trade Corridors (regional) | research | Not site-specific; no sensitivity flags | Build large-region H3 geometry |
| TBD-008 | Early Holocene Occupation Indicators | research | Broad-scale, multi-county | Establish uncertainty language |

You may add new rows as long as they follow the same column structure.
