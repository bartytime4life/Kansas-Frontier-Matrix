# 🏺 **Archaeology Story Node — Notes (KFM v11)**  
### *Drafts · Backlog · Sovereignty Reviews*  

`docs/story-nodes/domains/archaeology/notes/README.md`

**Purpose**  
Provide a workspace for **draft Story Nodes**, **ethics/sovereignty deliberation notes**,  
and **pending backlog items** for the archaeology domain.

## 🗂️ Directory Layout

~~~text
docs/story-nodes/domains/archaeology/notes/
├── 📄 README.md                       # This file
├── 📑 backlog.md                      # Candidate Story Nodes & work queue
└── ⚖️ ethics-checklist.md             # Sovereignty & CARE review checklist
~~~

This directory contains **non-final, non-public** notes used during development, review,  
and governance of archaeology Story Nodes.

---

## 📘 Overview

The **notes** directory serves as the staging area for:

- Draft Story Node concepts  
- Early outlines before JSON/Markdown conversion  
- Sovereignty considerations & ethical discussions  
- Masking decisions and generalization notes  
- Questions for tribal partners or domain reviewers  
- Items awaiting triage into the official example set or templates  

Nothing in this directory is considered final until it passes:

1. **Archaeology domain review**,  
2. **Indigenous data sovereignty review**,  
3. **story-node.schema.json** alignment,  
4. **FAIR+CARE** compliance checks.

---

## 🎯 Types of Material Allowed

✔ Drafts of Story Nodes (generalized, incomplete, or awaiting citations)  
✔ Notes on chronology, regional context, or archival data  
✔ Generalization decisions (H3 masking, county choice, etc.)  
✔ CARE-sensitive risk assessments  
✔ Backlog items to be turned into official examples  
✔ Reviewer commentary that is safe to store  

🚫 **Not permitted here:**  
- precise coordinates  
- burial/sacred locations  
- restricted internal excavation forms  
- restricted tribal knowledge  
- sensitive field photos  
- confidential site codes  
- anything prohibited under sovereignty rules  

---

## 📜 Workflow Integration

### 🧩 Draft → Review → Story Node  
1. Place early drafts in `backlog.md` or separate working files (if needed).  
2. Note CARE/sensitivity concerns in `ethics-checklist.md`.  
3. After reviewer approval, convert to:  
   - Markdown Story Node (author template), or  
   - JSON Story Node (schema-valid).  
4. Move finished work into `examples/` or into the main Story Node tree.

---

## 🧪 Validation

Although draft notes are not required to be schema-valid, they must still:

- Avoid any restricted content  
- Follow generalization rules  
- Use safe terminology  
- Avoid implying exact cultural attribution unless documented  
- Follow FAIR+CARE governance principles
