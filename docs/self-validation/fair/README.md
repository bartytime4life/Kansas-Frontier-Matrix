# ⚖️ **Kansas Frontier Matrix — FAIR+CARE Self-Validation Reports**
`docs/self-validation/fair/README.md`

**Purpose:** Document and index all FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and CARE (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, Ethics) validation reports for the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
These reports ensure that every dataset meets open data, ethical governance, and reproducibility standards under **Master Coder Protocol (MCP v6.3)**.

## 📘 Overview

The **FAIR+CARE Validation Reports** in this directory are generated by automated CI/CD pipelines using  
`.github/workflows/faircare-validate.yml`.  

Each report documents:
- FAIR compliance across dataset metadata, licenses, and provenance.
- CARE alignment for cultural, Indigenous, and ethical data stewardship.
- Governance review linkage via **Governance Ledger** and **Telemetry Dashboard**.

These reports ensure that all KFM datasets are ethically managed and technically interoperable for long-term scientific and cultural value.

## 🧾 Report Details

### 1. 🧠 `faircare_results.ndjson`
Contains one JSON object per dataset validated during the FAIR+CARE pipeline execution.

| Field | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `path` | Path to dataset manifest (e.g., `data/sources/*.json`). |
| `ok` | Boolean: true if dataset passed validation. |
| `errors` | Array of errors encountered (e.g., missing license, absent provenance). |
| `warnings` | Non-critical notes for improvement. |
| `care_required` | Boolean: indicates Indigenous/cultural relevance requiring governance review. |
| `timestamp` | Validation execution timestamp. |

**Example:**
```json
{
  "path": "data/sources/noaa_storms_1950_2025.json",
  "ok": true,
  "errors": [],
  "warnings": ["License not SPDX-aligned; equivalent CC-BY accepted."],
  "care_required": false,
  "timestamp": "2025-11-05T17:20:00Z"
}
```

---

### 2. ⚙️ `faircare_summary.json`
Summarized validation results for all datasets in a given run, referenced in governance and telemetry reports.

| Field | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `datasets_validated` | Total datasets reviewed. |
| `passed` | Number of datasets passing all checks. |
| `failed` | Number of datasets failing validation. |
| `care_reviews` | Count of datasets flagged for Indigenous/cultural review. |
| `timestamp` | UTC time of summary generation. |

**Example:**
```json
{
  "datasets_validated": 243,
  "passed": 238,
  "failed": 5,
  "care_reviews": 4,
  "timestamp": "2025-11-05T18:30:00Z"
}
```

**Generated By:** `.github/workflows/faircare-validate.yml`

## 🧩 Validation Workflow Overview

**Workflow:** `.github/workflows/faircare-validate.yml`

**Process Summary:**
1. Discover all manifests under `data/sources/*.json`.
2. Validate required FAIR fields (license, provenance, checksum, temporal, spatial).
3. Evaluate CARE compliance where Indigenous or cultural keywords detected.
4. Generate `faircare_results.ndjson` and `faircare_summary.json`.
5. Append entries to `reports/audit/governance-ledger.json`.
6. Export telemetry data to `releases/v9.7.0/focus-telemetry.json`.

---

## 🧠 Governance Integration

Each validation cycle is automatically recorded in:
```
reports/audit/governance-ledger.json
reports/audit/github-workflows-ledger.json
```

**Ledger Example:**
```json
{
  "event": "faircare_validation",
  "datasets_validated": 243,
  "passed": 238,
  "failed": 5,
  "timestamp": "2025-11-05T18:30:00Z",
  "telemetry_ref": "releases/v9.7.0/focus-telemetry.json"
}
```

## ⚖️ FAIR+CARE Principles Enforcement

| Principle | Validation Criteria |
|------------|--------------------|
| **Findable** | Dataset includes `id`, `title`, and `spatial` metadata. |
| **Accessible** | Dataset has public license (SPDX or CC-BY). |
| **Interoperable** | JSON schema conforms to STAC/DCAT compatibility. |
| **Reusable** | Metadata includes provenance and checksum. |
| **CARE** | Reviewed for cultural relevance, ownership, and permissions. |

If a dataset triggers a **CARE review**, a governance form is automatically opened via  
`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/governance_form.yml`.

---

## 🧮 Integration with Telemetry Dashboard

Data from `faircare_summary.json` is integrated into:
```
docs/reports/telemetry/governance_scorecard.json
```

**Dashboard Metrics Include:**
- Overall FAIR compliance rate (%)
- CARE review count
- License compliance rate
- Provenance completeness score
- Validation runtime metrics

**Example Aggregation:**
```json
{
  "faircare_score": 98.3,
  "datasets_reviewed": 243,
  "license_compliance": 100,
  "care_reviews": 4,
  "timestamp": "2025-11-05T18:30:00Z"
}
```

| Category | Policy |
|-----------|--------|
| **Retention Period** | Permanent archival (per release). |
| **Format** | NDJSON and JSON (UTF-8 encoded). |
| **Checksum Verification** | SHA-256 hashes stored in release manifest. |
| **Access** | Publicly available under CC-BY 4.0. |
