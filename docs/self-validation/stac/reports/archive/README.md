# 🗄️ **Kansas Frontier Matrix — Archived STAC Validation Reports**
`docs/self-validation/stac/reports/archive/README.md`

**Purpose:** Describe the archive of historical STAC validation reports and data integrity logs for the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
This archive serves as a **permanent, versioned record** of past validations to support transparency, reproducibility, and compliance with **Master Coder Protocol (MCP v6.3)** and **FAIR+CARE** data stewardship principles.

## 📘 Overview

This `archive/` directory preserves all **historical STAC validation logs** generated by automated pipelines and governance reviews from previous Kansas Frontier Matrix releases.  
Each archive file is digitally signed, timestamped, and verified using SHA-256 hashes stored within the Governance Ledger and Telemetry Dashboard.

Archives are immutable — once published, they **cannot be altered or deleted**, ensuring long-term audit integrity and scientific reproducibility.

## 🗂️ Directory Layout

```
docs/self-validation/stac/reports/archive/
├── README.md                           # This index file
├── stac_validation_v9.5.0.tar.gz       # Archived logs from release v9.5.0
├── stac_validation_v9.6.0.tar.gz       # Archived logs from release v9.6.0
└── stac_validation_v9.7.0.tar.gz       # Latest archive snapshot
```

Each `.tar.gz` file includes:
- Raw PySTAC validation results (`pystac_results.json`)
- STAC Validator CLI logs (`stac_validator_results.ndjson`)
- Aggregated summaries (`_summary.json`)
- Execution metadata (validator versions, runtime durations)
- Checksum manifest for digital verification

---

## 🔍 Archive Metadata Format

Each archive bundle includes a companion metadata file (embedded or external) describing validation context:

**Example:** `stac_validation_v9.7.0_metadata.json`
```json
{
  "release": "v9.7.0",
  "generated_on": "2025-11-05T18:00:00Z",
  "validator_version": "3.3.0",
  "datasets_validated": 52,
  "failed": 0,
  "schema_version": "STAC 1.0.0",
  "checksum_manifest": "stac_validation_v9.7.0_checksums.txt"
}
```

**Checksum Manifest Example:**
```txt
sha256-6f1e78a2ac431adff0d3f5be1aa3a18d75b5c4b962c9e9f13a2cf81e2fbd8337  pystac_results.json
sha256-482cd3a56a883945b2cd69b1dc4977a58f9a97a731204c89abdb48a774223ef5  stac_validator_results.ndjson
sha256-ec7f52dabc003e52e42fbc240b813c894a02f424c1b9e4b31b08a62f1f9f98f2  _summary.json
```

## 🧮 Validation & Governance Integration

Each archive is referenced by:
- `reports/audit/github-workflows-ledger.json` (for validation session tracking)
- `reports/audit/release-manifest-log.json` (for release-level manifest entries)
- `releases/v9.7.0/focus-telemetry.json` (for telemetry aggregation)
- `docs/reports/audit/README.md` (for governance mapping)

**Governance Ledger Example:**
```json
{
  "event": "archive_creation",
  "version": "v9.7.0",
  "timestamp": "2025-11-05T20:00:00Z",
  "sha256": "c420d2e7435d38983baf0287cbfa91d88500d4c8ed9a02ee764d96b2a1b18f52",
  "artifact": "docs/self-validation/stac/reports/archive/stac_validation_v9.7.0.tar.gz",
  "approved_by": "FAIR+CARE Council"
}
```

## 🧠 Use Cases

| Use Case | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Provenance Verification** | Verify that datasets in historical releases passed original STAC validation. |
| **Research Auditing** | Cross-reference historical validation states for reproducibility. |
| **Governance Review** | Provide traceability for past FAIR+CARE approvals. |
| **Telemetry Analysis** | Aggregate runtime and performance trends across releases. |

---

## ⚙️ Automated Archival Workflow

Archives are automatically generated by the following CI/CD steps:

**Workflow:** `.github/workflows/stac-validate.yml`

**Archival Steps:**
1. Execute full STAC validation for all datasets in `data/stac/**`.
2. Package JSON results and NDJSON logs into `stac_validation_vX.Y.Z.tar.gz`.
3. Compute SHA-256 checksums for all included files.
4. Update governance and release manifest ledgers.
5. Upload artifact to GitHub Releases and documentation tree.
