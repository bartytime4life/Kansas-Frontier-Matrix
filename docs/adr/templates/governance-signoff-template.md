## 📚 Purpose

The **Governance Sign-Off Template** is completed by the **FAIR+CARE Governance Council** after peer review and validation of an ADR.  
It provides a verifiable audit trail that links decision approval with provenance records and ethical verification data.  
Each sign-off must include:
- FAIR+CARE validation results  
- Governance board signatures  
- Checksum reference and ledger registration
