# 🧾 **Kansas Frontier Matrix — Architecture Decision Record Template (v2.1.1 · Tier-Ω+∞ Certified)**  
`docs/adr/templates/adr-template.md`

**Mission:** Serve as the **standardized template** for creating Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) in the **Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM)**.  
Ensures decisions are reproducible, FAIR+CARE-aligned, auditable, and validated through the governance ledger.

## 📘 ADR Metadata (Frontmatter)

Each ADR must begin with a **YAML metadata header** containing governance and provenance fields.

```yaml
---
adr_id: "ADR-000X"
title: "Short Descriptive Title of Decision"
status: "Proposed"            # Proposed | Accepted | Superseded | Rejected
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
authors: ["@kfm-architecture","@kfm-docs"]
reviewers: ["@kfm-governance","@kfm-security"]
governance_approval: "Pending FAIR+CARE Validation"
checksum: "<sha256-checksum>"
ledger_entry: "data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json"
license: "CC-BY 4.0"
---
```

---

## 🧩 1. Context

Describe the **problem statement** or situation that led to this decision.  
Include links to related documentation, ADRs, and validation reports.

**Example:**
> The KFM project required a unified schema to align geospatial, historical, and cultural datasets across multiple sources.  
> Current data representations lacked semantic interoperability between STAC metadata and CIDOC CRM-based knowledge graphs.

---

## 🧠 2. Decision

Clearly describe the **decision** being made and its technical or governance justification.

**Example:**
> Adopt **Neo4j** as the knowledge graph database with an ontology conforming to **CIDOC CRM** and **OWL-Time**,  
> ensuring semantic integration between datasets, events, and geospatial entities.

---

## ⚙️ 3. Considered Alternatives

List and evaluate the alternative solutions or approaches considered.  
Provide brief reasoning for why they were not chosen.

| Option | Description | Outcome |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **RDF Triple Store (Blazegraph)** | Provides flexible SPARQL queries but lacks graph performance at scale. | ❌ Rejected |
| **Property Graph (Neo4j)** | High-performance, developer-friendly schema; supports Cypher queries. | ✅ Selected |
| **Document Store (MongoDB)** | Easy storage but limited semantic reasoning capabilities. | ⚠️ Limited applicability |

---

## 🔍 4. Consequences

Summarize the **outcomes** of the decision — positive, negative, or neutral.

- ✅ Improved semantic reasoning and FAIR data discovery.  
- ⚠️ Increased complexity in ontology management.  
- 🧩 Requires schema validation workflows (`ontology-validate.yml`).  
- 🧾 Adds governance dependencies with FAIR+CARE oversight.

---

## 🧱 5. Implementation Plan

Outline the steps or tasks necessary to implement the decision.

```yaml
implementation_plan:
  - Create Neo4j schema using CIDOC CRM mappings.
  - Integrate FAIR+CARE governance metadata in graph loader.
  - Validate RDF exports for STAC/DCAT interoperability.
  - Log ontology updates in `data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json`.
```

---

## ⚖️ 6. Governance & FAIR+CARE Validation

Provide the ethical and governance considerations of the decision.

| Principle | Implementation | Reviewer | Status |
|:--|:--|:--|:--:|
| **Findable** | Decision logged in manifest and governance ledger. | @kfm-docs | ✅ |
| **Accessible** | ADR open and versioned under CC-BY 4.0. | @kfm-governance | ✅ |
| **Interoperable** | Metadata linked to FAIR+CARE schema. | @kfm-architecture | ✅ |
| **Reusable** | ADR template reusable for future systems. | @kfm-docs | ✅ |
| **Collective Benefit (CARE)** | Decision promotes openness and inclusivity. | @kfm-governance | ✅ |

---

## 🧮 7. Validation Workflows

List associated validation workflows that confirm this ADR’s implementation and governance status.

| Workflow | Function | Output |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `policy-check.yml` | Ensures ADR metadata and compliance. | `reports/audit/policy_check.json` |
| `docs-validate.yml` | Validates structure, diagrams, and frontmatter. | `reports/validation/docs_validation.json` |
| `governance-ledger.yml` | Records checksum and governance sign-off. | `data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json` |

---
