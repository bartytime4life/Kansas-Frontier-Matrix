## 📚 Overview

This directory contains **templates, decision guides, and best practices** for documenting major architectural or governance choices under KFM.  
All templates align with the **MCP-DL v6.4.3** documentation standard and support FAIR+CARE traceability.

Each ADR template:
- Defines a consistent structure for capturing technical rationale and consequences.  
- Integrates governance and provenance references for reproducibility.  
- Is validated through CI workflows for metadata completeness and FAIR+CARE compliance.
