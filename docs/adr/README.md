# üß© **Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî Architecture Decision Records (ADR) Hub (v2.1.1 ¬∑ Tier-Œ©+‚àû Certified)**  
`docs/adr/README.md`

**Mission:** Centralize all **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** for the **Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM)** project.  
Each record captures the rationale, context, consequences, and governance validation for significant technical or ethical design choices.

## üìö Overview

The **Architecture Decision Record (ADR) system** ensures that every major technical, design, or governance decision in KFM  
is recorded transparently with full provenance, rationale, and FAIR+CARE ethical alignment.  

Each ADR file is self-contained, following MCP-DL standards and validated automatically through CI/CD pipelines.
