# Root Governance Charter

Defines governance scope, decision rights, escalation, and accountability for Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).

## Core rules
- Governance defaults to fail-closed when policy metadata is missing.
- Policy changes require recorded review and versioned change logging.
- Escalations follow the reviewer quorum listed in `roles/REVIEWERS.md`.
