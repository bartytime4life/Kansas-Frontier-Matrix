## Our Pledge

We are committed to making participation in the KFM project welcoming and safe.

We will not tolerate harassment or discrimination. This includes (but is not limited to) harm based on:
- age
- body size
- disability (visible or invisible)
- ethnicity or national origin
- gender identity or expression
- level of experience or education
- neurotype
- personal appearance
- race
- religion
- sexual identity or orientation
- socioeconomic status
- any other protected characteristic

We also recognize that “safety” includes **privacy** and **cultural responsibility**, especially when working with historical, geospatial, and community-linked information.

## Community Standards

### Expected behavior

Examples of behavior that strengthens the community:
- **Be respectful**: disagree without being disagreeable; critique ideas, not people.
- **Be constructive**: ask clarifying questions, propose alternatives, and give actionable feedback.
- **Be inclusive**: use welcoming language; make space for different perspectives and backgrounds.
- **Assume good intent, request evidence**: treat claims as discussable, and ask for sources when needed.
- **Practice evidence-first collaboration**:
  - cite sources when making factual claims in project work (issues, PRs, docs)
  - label uncertainty instead of overstating
  - correct mistakes openly and promptly
- **Respect privacy and safety boundaries**:
  - don’t share personal data, private communications, or identifying details without consent
  - don’t publish sensitive locations (e.g., precise coordinates) when policy or stewardship indicates those must be protected
- **Honor stewardship decisions**: if a steward/reviewer flags something as sensitive (rights, privacy, cultural restrictions), treat that as a safety requirement—not a debate to “win.”

### Unacceptable behavior

Examples of behavior that is not acceptable:
- Harassment, intimidation, threats, or hateful conduct (public or private).
- Sexualized language, unwelcome attention, or harassment of any kind.
- Doxxing, outing, or sharing anyone’s personal information without explicit consent.
- Sharing or attempting to spread **restricted** or **sensitive** content (including protected-location details) outside allowed channels.
- Deliberate deception in project work (e.g., knowingly falsifying citations, evidence, or provenance in official contributions).
- Sustained disruption (derailing threads, trolling, “dogpiling,” or otherwise preventing others from participating).

---

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers / moderators / designated stewards are responsible for:
- clarifying community standards when needed
- addressing harmful behavior
- taking appropriate action to protect participants and the project

They may remove, edit, or reject contributions (issues, comments, PRs, docs) that violate this Code of Conduct.

---

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:
- repository spaces (issues, PRs, reviews, discussions, wikis)
- official project communication channels (as applicable)
- project events or community spaces
- public spaces when someone is representing KFM (e.g., speaking “as KFM,” using official accounts, or acting as a project representative)

---

## Reporting

If you experience or witness conduct that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it.

### Where to report

**Primary contact:** `[CONDUCT_EMAIL]`  
> **TODO:** Replace `[CONDUCT_EMAIL]` with a monitored address (or a documented reporting route) before publishing.

If you believe you are in immediate danger, prioritize your safety and contact local emergency services.

### What to include in a report (as available)

- What happened (a concise description)
- Where it happened (link(s) to thread/issue/PR, screenshots if relevant)
- When it happened (date/time and time zone if possible)
- Who was involved (usernames, if known)
- Any context that might help (prior related interactions)
- Your preference for confidentiality and follow-up

### What you can expect

- Reports are handled as sensitively as possible.
- Only those needed to respond will be included.
- If an outcome is possible to share safely, we will share what we can with the reporter.

---

## Enforcement Guidelines

When action is needed, maintainers/stewards will choose a response proportionate to the behavior and the harm caused. In severe cases, steps may be skipped.

### Level 1 — Correction

**When:** minor boundary crossing; unintentional harm; correctable behavior  
**Possible actions:** request to stop; edit/remove a comment; clarify expectations

### Level 2 — Warning

**When:** repeated Level 1 issues, or a clear violation that doesn’t warrant removal  
**Possible actions:** formal warning; contribution restrictions for a limited scope

### Level 3 — Temporary Restrictions

**When:** sustained disruption; harassment; retaliation; ignoring warnings  
**Possible actions:** temporary ban from participation; temporary removal of access to project spaces

### Level 4 — Permanent Restrictions

**When:** serious harassment, threats, hate conduct, or repeated violations after prior actions  
**Possible actions:** permanent ban; removal of project access; escalation to platform enforcement when necessary

### Appeals

If you believe an enforcement decision was made in error, you may request review by replying to the enforcement contact and clearly stating:
- the action you are appealing
- why you believe it was incorrect
- any additional context or evidence
