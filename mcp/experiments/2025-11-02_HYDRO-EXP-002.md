# 💧 **HYDRO-EXP-002 — Hydrology Multi-Source Fusion Validation**
`mcp/experiments/2025-11-02_HYDRO-EXP-002.md`

**Purpose**  
Validate the multi-source fusion methodology that integrates **USGS**, **USACE**, **Mesonet**, and
**ERA5**–derived hydrology predictions into a unified flow/inflow/outflow series for Kansas basins.

</div>

---

## 📘 Overview

### Objective
Evaluate the fusion algorithm used in Hydrology Seq2Seq v11 pipelines to create stable, high-quality hydrology reconstructions across Kansas watersheds.

### Hypothesis
A **weighted hybrid ensemble** using USGS/USACE observations and climate-driven inference (ERA5 + Mesonet) will outperform any single-source reconstruction on:

- RMSE
- Seasonal stability
- Extreme-event reconstruction
- Basin-to-basin generalizability

### Reported outputs
- Derived datasets:
  - `data/processed/hydrology/reconstructed/fusion_v11/`
- Provenance + lineage:
  - `data/provenance/experiments/hydrology/2025-11-02/`
- Telemetry:
  - `releases/v11.0.0/mcp-experiments-telemetry.json`

## 🧭 Context

Hydrology reconstructions are necessary because:

- Many USGS gauges have discontinuities
- USACE reservoir inflow/outflow data has gaps
- Climate-era datasets help backfill early-century missing data

Hydrology supports:
- Reservoir management
- Story Node environmental context
- Flood/drought analysis
- Climate–hydrology coupling in KFM pipelines

HYDRO-EXP-002 tests the fusion model before hydrology pipeline deployment.

## 📦 Data & Metadata

### Datasets (STAC/DCAT identifiers as referenced)
| Dataset | ID | Notes |
|--------|------|------|
| USGS Daily Flow | `stac:hydrology/usgs_daily` | Observations |
| USACE Reservoir Ops | `stac:hydrology/usace_ops` | Storage/inflow/outflow |
| PRISM climate | `stac:climate/prism` | Baseline climate |
| ERA5 | `stac:climate/era5` | Climate-forced hydrology inference |
| Mesonet | `stac:climate/mesonet` | Precip/ET corrections |
| Terrain DEM | `stac:terrain/dem` | Watershed features |

### Configuration (as reported)
~~~yaml
window: "1910–2024"
resolution: "daily"
basins_tested: 20

fusion_method: "weighted_ensemble"
weights_initial:
  usgs: 0.55
  usace: 0.25
  era5: 0.15
  mesonet: 0.05

seed: 441199
~~~

### Environment (as reported)
- Docker: `kfm/hydro-env:v11`
- Compute: A100 40GB
- Framework: PyTorch 2.2 + XGBoost fusion layer

---

## 🧱 Architecture

### 1. Preprocessing
- Standardize CRS (EPSG:4326)
- Resample all flows to daily
- Normalize units:
  - Flow: cfs
  - Inflow/outflow: AF/day (via conversion where required)
- Identify missing periods → mask
- Remove storms >99th percentile (separate validation)

### 2. Compute partial reconstructions
1. USGS direct
2. USACE storage inversion → inflow/outflow
3. ERA5 climate-forced prediction
4. Mesonet precipitation-driven estimates

Each produces a candidate series.

### 3. Weighted fusion
~~~text
flow_fused = Σ (w_i * series_i)
~~~

Weights optimized via:
- Basin-wise RMSE
- Seasonal cycle preservation
- Cross-basin generalizability
- Gradient-free Powell tuning

### 4. Extreme event correction
Use residual correction model to restore:
- Peak flow accuracy
- Flood signature sharpness
- Drought persistence pattern

### 5. Validation framework (metrics)
- RMSE
- MAE
- NSE (Nash–Sutcliffe)
- Spatial error transfer across basins
- Extreme sensitivity

---

## 🧪 Validation & CI/CD

### Metrics summary (as reported)
| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| RMSE | 13.6 cfs |
| MAE | 8.1 cfs |
| NSE | 0.92 |
| Seasonal retention | 0.95 |
| Flood-event fidelity | 0.91 |
| Drought stability | 0.94 |

### Observations (as reported)
- Fusion consistently outperformed single-source inputs
- Climate-driven backfills improved early-century periods
- Mesonet corrections improved summer anomaly reconstruction

### Failure modes & recovery (as reported)

**Common failures**
- ERA5 over-smoothing
- USACE storage inversion instability
- Mesonet station outages
- Western KS basin instability

**Recovery steps**
- Increase USGS weight
- Rebalance climate contributions
- Use fallback spline infill
- Apply watershed similarity weighting
