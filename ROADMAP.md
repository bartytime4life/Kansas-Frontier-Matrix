## Milestone 5 ‚Äî MCP Integration

* **\[Issue] Experiment Reports**

  * [ ] Use template from `mcp/experiments/experiment_template.md`.
  * [ ] Populate first 3 experiments (georeferencing, NLP, predictive site modeling).

* **\[Issue] SOP Documentation**

  * [ ] Add `mcp/sops/georeference_map.md`.
  * [ ] Add `mcp/sops/add_dataset.md`.

* **\[Issue] Model Cards**

  * [ ] Create `mcp/model_cards/nlp_placename.md`.
  * [ ] Create `mcp/model_cards/change_detection.md`.

* **\[Issue] CI/CD Reproducibility**

  * [ ] Add GitHub Actions test to validate STAC JSON.
  * [ ] Add `make reproducibility-check` target.
