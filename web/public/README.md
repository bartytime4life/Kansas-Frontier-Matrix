## 🧭 Overview

The `web/public/` directory contains **all static assets** served directly by the web application.  
These include the main **HTML entry point**, **favicons**, **logos**, **web manifest**,  
and any other files required at runtime that are not processed by the build pipeline.

This directory acts as the **root of the deployed web client**, aligning with **Vite’s** and **React’s**  
default static asset conventions. Everything placed here will be copied into the final  
`build/` output directory verbatim.

Under the **Master Coder Protocol (MCP)**, every public artifact must have a clear purpose,  
traceable provenance, and version-controlled design linkage.

🧩 Key Files and Their Roles

🏠 index.html

The main HTML template for the application.
Vite injects compiled React bundles and CSS into this file during build.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <meta name="description" content="Kansas Frontier Matrix — Explore Kansas history through space and time." />
    <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
    <title>Kansas Frontier Matrix</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to use Kansas Frontier Matrix.</noscript>
    <div id="root"></div>
  </body>
</html>


⸻

📱 manifest.webmanifest

Defines Progressive Web App (PWA) metadata so the application can be
installed on devices like a native app.

{
  "name": "Kansas Frontier Matrix",
  "short_name": "FrontierMatrix",
  "start_url": "/",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#0b1020",
  "theme_color": "#00b3b3",
  "icons": [
    { "src": "/assets/icons/icon-192.png", "sizes": "192x192", "type": "image/png" },
    { "src": "/assets/icons/icon-512.png", "sizes": "512x512", "type": "image/png" }
  ]
}

This file pulls brand colors and theme info from web/config/themes.json during build.

⸻

🤖 robots.txt

Specifies which parts of the site should be indexed by search engines.

User-agent: *
Allow: /
Sitemap: https://frontiermatrix.org/sitemap.xml


⸻

🗺️ sitemap.xml

Auto-generated by CI to mirror all accessible public routes,
including the interactive map, about page, and documentation.

<urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9">
  <url>
    <loc>https://frontiermatrix.org/</loc>
    <changefreq>weekly</changefreq>
    <priority>1.0</priority>
  </url>
</urlset>


⸻

🎨 assets/

Contains static imagery and branding elements such as logos and
UI icons used throughout the React application. These are not imported
as modules but served statically from /assets/.

All assets follow the Design System specifications documented under
docs/design/mockups/ and must include metadata (license and source).

⸻

🧩 Integration With Build System
	•	The index.html file is injected by Vite during build.
	•	manifest.webmanifest and robots.txt are copied unchanged to /build/.
	•	The favicon and icons are referenced directly from the public root (/favicon.ico).
	•	Environment variables defined in .env affect runtime metadata (e.g., app name).
	•	Checksums for public files are computed in CI for reproducibility.

⸻

♿ Accessibility and SEO

Concern	Implementation
Semantic HTML	index.html uses appropriate headings, language attributes, and ARIA regions.
Color Contrast	Images/icons designed for contrast compliance (≥ 4.5:1).
Alt Text	All images include descriptive alt attributes.
Metadata	Includes Open Graph and Twitter card meta tags for sharing previews.
Search Indexing	robots.txt and sitemap.xml maintained automatically in CI.


⸻

🧾 Provenance & Integrity

Artifact	Description
Inputs	Branding assets, manifest data, sitemap generator, theme colors
Outputs	Deployed static assets under build/public/
Dependencies	Vite, Node.js, TailwindCSS, Favicon Generator
Integrity	CI computes SHA256 checksums; assets versioned via Git and verified in deployment pipeline
