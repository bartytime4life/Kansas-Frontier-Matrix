## 📚 Overview

The **Governance and Ethics Image Assets** directory includes official visuals for governance documentation, audit processes, ethics council reporting, and FAIR+CARE certification displays.  
Each asset is provenance-linked, checksum-verified, and maintained in accordance with MCP-DL v6.3 reproducibility protocols.

### Core Responsibilities:
- Provide consistent imagery for FAIR+CARE, audit, and ethical council publications.  
- Ensure compliance with ISO metadata and WCAG accessibility standards.  
- Maintain checksum lineage for all audit and certification graphics.  
- Support transparent, ethical communication across governance reports.
