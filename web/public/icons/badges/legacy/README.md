## 🧩 Governance Purpose

Legacy badge icons provide a transparent historical record of Kansas Frontier Matrix’s evolving governance and compliance ecosystem.  
These assets remain immutable under **FAIR+CARE stewardship** to ensure reproducibility, licensing continuity, and verifiable provenance.

**Objectives**
- 🔐 **Integrity:** Verify historical certifications and prevent tampering with audit evidence.  
- 🧾 **Traceability:** Link each deprecated badge to its updated successor.  
- ♿ **Accessibility Archive:** Retain legacy accessibility design data for regression comparison.  
- 🧭 **Provenance:** Document authorship, certification origins, and historical usage context.
