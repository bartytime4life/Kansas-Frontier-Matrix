# 🔐 Kansas Frontier Matrix — **Certification Badge Checksums**
`web/public/icons/badges/legacy/checksums/README.md`

**Purpose:** Maintains immutable SHA-256 checksum manifests for all legacy certification and governance badges. Guarantees data integrity, traceability, and FAIR+CARE compliance for historical certification marks under MCP-DL v6.4.3 governance standards.

## 🧩 Checksum Policy

| Attribute | Specification | Description |
|------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Algorithm** | SHA-256 | Each badge checksum generated using SHA-256 cryptographic hash. |
| **Format** | `<hash>  <filename>` | Stored in plaintext for transparency and compatibility. |
| **Verification Command** | `sha256sum -c <file>.sha256` | Standard command-line validation. |
| **Audit Frequency** | Quarterly (Governance Review) | Run automatically during FAIR+CARE audit cycle. |
| **Storage Policy** | Immutable | Checksum files are permanent, unmodifiable records. |

Each `.sha256` record corresponds to an SVG asset in `/legacy/` and is verified via CI/CD and audit workflows.

---

## ⚙️ CI/CD Validation Workflow

**Workflow:** `.github/workflows/icon-checksum-validate.yml`

**Automated Steps**
1. Generate new SHA-256 hash for every legacy badge.  
2. Compare against committed `.sha256` records.  
3. Log results to:  
   - `reports/self-validation/web-icons-badges-legacy-checksums-validation.json`  
   - `reports/audit/web-icons-faircare.json`  
4. Sync integrity metrics with the Governance Ledger.  
5. Append telemetry results to `releases/v9.5.0/focus-telemetry.json`.  

**Example CLI Check**
```bash
sha256sum -c icon-badge-diamond9-v1.sha256
# Output: icon-badge-diamond9-v1.svg: OK
```

```

*Confirms `icon-badge-faircare-v1.svg` remains unaltered since archival on 2025-09-25.*

## 🔒 Governance & Archive Policy

| Policy | Description | Enforcement |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Immutable Archive** | Checksum manifests cannot be modified or deleted. | Protected branch and Governance Ledger lock. |
| **Checksum Verification** | Each legacy badge must include a matching `.sha256` record. | CI/CD validation requirement. |
| **Cross-Validation** | Checksum entries must correspond with `/legacy/meta/` metadata. | Schema-validated automatically. |
| **Audit Logging** | Results of all validations stored in FAIR+CARE audit reports. | Managed by automated CI/CD audit pipelines. |

## 📊 Telemetry & FAIR+CARE Metrics

Checksum telemetry results recorded in `releases/v9.5.0/focus-telemetry.json` include:
- ✅ Total number of legacy badges verified  
- ⚠️ Hash discrepancies detected (if any)  
- 🧾 Metadata linkage success rate  
- 💠 FAIR+CARE compliance index  
- 🔒 Archive immutability percentage  

Telemetry data is synced with the **Governance Ledger Dashboard** for transparent visualization.
