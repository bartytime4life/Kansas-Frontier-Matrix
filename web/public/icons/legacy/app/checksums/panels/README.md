# 🔐 Kansas Frontier Matrix — **Panel Icon Checksum Archive**
`web/public/icons/legacy/app/checksums/panels/README.md`

**Purpose:** Archives and verifies SHA-256 checksums for all legacy panel interface icons from earlier Kansas Frontier Matrix versions. Guarantees data integrity, reproducibility, and compliance with FAIR+CARE and MCP-DL v6.4.3 governance protocols.

## 🧩 Checksum Policy

| Attribute | Specification | Description |
|------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Algorithm** | SHA-256 | Industry-standard cryptographic hash ensuring file immutability. |
| **Format** | `<hash>  <filename>` | Stored as plain text for compatibility and audit readability. |
| **Verification Command** | `sha256sum -c <file>.sha256` | Used for both local and automated integrity checks. |
| **Validation Frequency** | Quarterly | Conducted automatically during FAIR+CARE audit cycles. |
| **Storage Policy** | Immutable | Checksum manifests are permanent and cannot be altered. |

Each checksum guarantees that the original asset remains unchanged since archival, ensuring reproducible visual validation.

---

## ⚙️ CI/CD Validation Workflow

**Workflow:** `.github/workflows/icon-checksum-validate.yml`

**Automated Steps**
1. Generate SHA-256 hash for each legacy panel icon.  
2. Compare computed hash against stored `.sha256` files.  
3. Record validation results in:  
   - `reports/self-validation/web-icons-legacy-app-checksums-panels-validation.json`  
   - `reports/audit/web-icons-faircare.json`  
4. Update verification telemetry (`releases/v9.5.0/focus-telemetry.json`).  
5. Escalate discrepancies to the Governance Council for investigation.

**Example CLI Validation**
```bash
sha256sum -c icon-panel-expand-v1.sha256
# Output: icon-panel-expand-v1.svg: OK
```

## 🔒 Governance & Compliance Policy

| Policy | Description | Enforcement |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Immutable Archive** | Checksum records cannot be modified or deleted. | Protected branch and governance audit lock. |
| **Checksum Validation** | Each icon must have a corresponding `.sha256` manifest. | Verified during CI/CD workflows. |
| **Cross-Linking** | Every checksum connects to its metadata in `/legacy/app/panels/meta/`. | Schema validation required. |
| **Audit Logging** | Verification results appended to FAIR+CARE reports. | Synced with Governance Ledger automatically. |

## 📊 Telemetry & FAIR+CARE Metrics

Checksum telemetry (recorded in `releases/v9.5.0/focus-telemetry.json`) includes:
- ✅ Total legacy icons validated  
- ⚠️ Discrepancies identified (if any)  
- 🔐 Archive immutability percentage  
- 🧾 Metadata crosslink completeness  
- 💠 FAIR+CARE compliance score  

These telemetry metrics are published in the Governance Ledger for transparency and reproducibility audits.
