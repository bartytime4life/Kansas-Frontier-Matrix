# 🔐 Kansas Frontier Matrix — **Application Icon Checksums**
`web/public/icons/legacy/app/checksums/README.md`

**Purpose:** Central repository for all SHA-256 checksum manifests verifying the integrity of legacy application icons (navigation, panels, dashboard, timeline, alerts, and forms). Ensures tamper-proof verification and FAIR+CARE-aligned provenance tracking for every archived UI asset.

## 🧩 Governance Purpose

This directory provides **cryptographic verification** for all archived application icons, ensuring their immutability and trustworthiness for compliance, provenance analysis, and design lineage preservation.

**Core Objectives**
- 🔐 **Integrity:** Guarantee authenticity through SHA-256 verification.  
- 🧾 **Provenance:** Cross-reference checksum files with icon metadata.  
- ♿ **Accessibility Preservation:** Maintain alignment between verified icons and accessibility audit reports.  
- 🧭 **Reproducibility:** Enable full reconstruction of legacy UI iconography from verifiable hashes.  

---

## ⚙️ Validation & Audit Workflow

**Workflow:** `.github/workflows/icon-checksum-validate.yml`

**Automated Validation Includes**
- ✅ Generate and verify SHA-256 checksums for all legacy app icons.  
- 🔐 Validate against committed `.sha256` manifests.  
- 🧾 Crosslink checksum entries with metadata records.  
- ⚖️ Integrate validation logs into FAIR+CARE audit pipeline.  
- 💠 Append results to `releases/v9.5.0/focus-telemetry.json` and Governance Ledger.  

Audit results are stored in:
- `reports/self-validation/web-icons-legacy-app-checksums-validation.json`
- `reports/audit/web-icons-faircare.json`

**Example CLI Command**
```bash
sha256sum -c icon-form-delete-v1.sha256
# Output: icon-form-delete-v1.svg: OK
```

## 🧾 Example Checksum Record

```text
e59b3a1e72c4e957ad5d2c423a18bdb47f083c6d5a3aabfc4a4a717cd73d6f91  icon-panel-settings-v1.svg
```

*Confirms authenticity of `icon-panel-settings-v1.svg` since archival on 2025-09-25.*

## 🔒 Archive & Compliance Policy

| Policy | Description | Enforcement |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Immutable Archive** | All checksum manifests are permanent and version-controlled. | Protected branches & CI/CD validation. |
| **Checksum Enforcement** | Every SVG must have a `.sha256` file. | Automated in CI/CD audit pipelines. |
| **Metadata Linkage** | Each checksum cross-linked with corresponding metadata JSON. | Schema-validated. |
| **Audit Logging** | All verification results appended to FAIR+CARE audit records. | Synced to Governance Ledger. |

---

## 📊 Telemetry & FAIR+CARE Metrics

Checksum telemetry metrics stored in `releases/v9.5.0/focus-telemetry.json` include:
- ✅ Total legacy icons verified  
- ⚠️ Mismatch detection rate  
- 🔐 Archive immutability index  
- 🧾 Metadata linkage integrity score  
- 💠 FAIR+CARE compliance rating  

All telemetry data is visualized through the **Governance Ledger Dashboard** for open auditing and verification.

---

## 🧱 Directory Integration

This checksum archive links directly to:
- `web/public/icons/legacy/app/meta/` — Metadata verification source  
- `web/public/icons/legacy/app/` — Primary application legacy directory  
- `reports/` — Validation and FAIR+CARE audit reports  

Together, they ensure total reproducibility and audit-grade provenance of historical KFM interface icons.
