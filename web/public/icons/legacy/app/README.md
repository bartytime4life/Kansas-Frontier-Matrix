# 🧭 Kansas Frontier Matrix — **Application Icon Legacy Archive**
`web/public/icons/legacy/app/README.md`

**Purpose:** Archives all deprecated application-level icons (navigation, panels, dashboard, timeline, alerts, and forms) from past Kansas Frontier Matrix releases. Ensures full traceability, checksum verification, and FAIR+CARE compliance under immutable MCP-DL v6.4.3 governance.

## 🧩 Governance Purpose

This archive represents the full design evolution of Kansas Frontier Matrix’s **application interface icons**.  
It ensures that all visual elements from prior versions remain verifiable, licensed, and traceable to their design lineage.

**Objectives**
- 🔐 **Integrity:** Preserve original files with cryptographic verification.  
- 🧾 **Traceability:** Maintain provenance and metadata for every icon.  
- ♿ **Accessibility:** Retain historic accessibility reports for audit continuity.  
- 🧭 **FAIR+CARE Compliance:** Uphold ethical, transparent, and reproducible documentation practices.  

---

## ⚙️ Validation & Audit Framework

**Workflow:** `.github/workflows/icon-archive-validate.yml`

**Automated Validation Includes**
- ✅ Metadata validation against `schemas/ui/icons.schema.json`  
- 🔐 SHA-256 checksum verification (linked to `/checksums/`)  
- 🧾 FAIR+CARE compliance and completeness scoring  
- ⚖️ Licensing validation (MIT, CC-BY, or public domain)  
- ♿ Accessibility regression review  

Reports stored in:
- `reports/self-validation/web-icons-legacy-app-validation.json`
- `reports/audit/web-icons-faircare.json`

## 🔒 Archive & Compliance Policies

| Policy | Description | Enforcement |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Immutable Archive** | Legacy files cannot be modified or deleted. | Protected branches and CI/CD enforcement. |
| **Checksum Validation** | Every legacy SVG requires verified `.sha256` manifest. | Automated during CI/CD audits. |
| **Replacement Mapping** | Each deprecated icon links to its successor in metadata. | Schema validation required. |
| **Accessibility Record** | Accessibility data retained per icon family. | Logged in FAIR+CARE audit reports. |
| **Ethical Licensing** | Each asset must include author, license, and provenance data. | FAIR+CARE governance enforcement. |

## 📊 Telemetry & FAIR+CARE Metrics

Telemetry (stored in `releases/v9.5.0/focus-telemetry.json`) includes:
- ✅ Total archived app icons  
- 🔐 Checksum verification rate  
- 🧾 Metadata completeness percentage  
- ♿ Accessibility audit retention  
- 💠 FAIR+CARE compliance score  

All metrics are mirrored in the **Governance Ledger Dashboard** for transparent reporting.
