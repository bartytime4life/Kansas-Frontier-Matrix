## 🧩 Governance Purpose

This archive preserves KFM’s **historical alert and system notification icons**, capturing their design lineage and evolution.  
Each file includes immutable metadata, licensing details, and checksum records for verifiable provenance.

**Core Objectives**
- 🔐 **Integrity:** Maintain SHA-256 checksum validation for all icons.  
- 🧾 **Traceability:** Document author, license, and replacement mappings.  
- ♿ **Accessibility:** Retain legacy accessibility and contrast compliance data.  
- 🧭 **Ethical Governance:** Uphold FAIR+CARE standards of openness and auditability.

## ⚙️ Validation & Audit Framework

**Workflow:** `.github/workflows/icon-archive-validate.yml`

**Automated Tasks**
- ✅ Metadata validation using `schemas/ui/icons.schema.json`  
- 🔐 Checksum comparison with `/legacy/app/alerts/checksums/`  
- 🧾 FAIR+CARE completeness validation  
- ⚖️ License and author verification  
- ♿ Accessibility regression recordkeeping  

Audit reports stored in:
- `reports/self-validation/web-icons-legacy-app-alerts-validation.json`  
- `reports/audit/web-icons-faircare.json`
