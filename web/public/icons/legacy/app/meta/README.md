# 📜 Kansas Frontier Matrix — **Application Icon Metadata Archive**
`web/public/icons/legacy/app/meta/README.md`

**Purpose:** Serves as the centralized repository for metadata files associated with all legacy application icons (navigation, panels, dashboard, timeline, alerts, and forms). Provides permanent provenance, licensing, checksum linkage, and FAIR+CARE-aligned reproducibility.

## 🧩 Governance Purpose

This archive ensures complete **traceability and transparency** across all legacy Kansas Frontier Matrix UI components.  
Each metadata record is immutable, versioned, and linked to corresponding checksums and FAIR+CARE audit logs.

**Core Objectives**
- 🔐 **Integrity:** Every legacy icon is verifiable via linked checksums.  
- 🧾 **Provenance:** Metadata documents authorship, license, and replacement lineage.  
- ♿ **Accessibility:** Retains legacy WCAG compliance and design evolution records.  
- 🧭 **Reproducibility:** Enables open reconstruction of previous UI states for research and audit purposes.  

---

## ⚙️ Validation & Audit Workflow

**Workflow:** `.github/workflows/icon-meta-validate.yml`

**Automated Steps**
- ✅ Validate metadata JSONs (`schemas/ui/icons.schema.json`)  
- 🔐 Cross-reference with corresponding `/checksums/` manifests  
- 🧾 Verify FAIR+CARE completeness for each metadata record  
- ⚖️ Audit license, creator, and replacement mapping integrity  
- 💠 Append validation outcomes to `releases/v9.5.0/focus-telemetry.json`  

Reports stored in:
- `reports/self-validation/web-icons-legacy-app-meta-validation.json`  
- `reports/audit/web-icons-faircare.json`

## 📊 Telemetry & FAIR+CARE Metrics

Telemetry metrics recorded in `releases/v9.5.0/focus-telemetry.json` include:
- ✅ Metadata completeness index  
- 🔐 Checksum linkage validation  
- 🧾 License and provenance documentation success rate  
- ♿ Accessibility record traceability  
- 💠 FAIR+CARE compliance index  

All telemetry results are visible in the **Governance Ledger Dashboard** for reproducibility tracking.
