## 🧩 Governance Purpose

The **Legacy Dashboard Archive** documents historical analytics and governance iconography from earlier KFM versions.  
This ensures continuity in design evolution and traceable provenance across UI updates.

**Core Objectives**
- 🔐 **Integrity:** Guarantee all icons maintain checksum verification and cryptographic proof.  
- 🧾 **Provenance:** Maintain design lineage with replacement references and author attribution.  
- ♿ **Accessibility:** Retain historical validation data for WCAG compliance records.  
- 🧭 **Reproducibility:** Provide transparent linkage between past and current dashboard visuals.  

---

## ⚙️ Validation & Audit Framework

**Workflow:** `.github/workflows/icon-archive-validate.yml`

**Automated Steps**
- ✅ Validate all JSON metadata (`schemas/ui/icons.schema.json`)  
- 🔐 Verify SHA-256 checksums against `/legacy/app/dashboard/checksums/`  
- 🧾 Run FAIR+CARE completeness audits  
- ⚖️ Validate author and license information  
- ♿ Verify accessibility regression records  

Reports generated:
- `reports/self-validation/web-icons-legacy-app-dashboard-validation.json`  
- `reports/audit/web-icons-faircare.json`
