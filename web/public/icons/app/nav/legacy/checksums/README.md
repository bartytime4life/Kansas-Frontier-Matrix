# 🔐 Kansas Frontier Matrix — **Navigation Icon Checksums**
`web/public/icons/app/nav/legacy/checksums/README.md`

**Purpose:** Defines checksum verification, archival integrity, and governance of legacy navigation icon hashes to ensure immutability and authenticity under FAIR+CARE and MCP-DL v6.4.3 standards.

## 🧩 Purpose & Compliance Framework

This directory contains **cryptographic hash manifests (SHA-256)** that verify file immutability and provenance for all archived navigation icons.  
It is governed under:
- **MCP-DL v6.4.3:** Documentation-first reproducibility protocol  
- **FAIR+CARE:** Data integrity, traceability, and ethical stewardship  
- **ISO 17025 / ISO 27037:** Evidence-handling and digital forensics compliance (internal alignment)

Checksums ensure that every historical asset remains **verifiably unmodified** since archival, supporting MCP’s chain-of-custody model.

---

## 🔍 Checksum Policy

| Field | Rule | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **Algorithm** | SHA-256 | Default cryptographic standard for file verification. |
| **Format** | Plain text file `<filename>.sha256` | Contains a single line with the checksum followed by the file name. |
| **Verification Command** | `sha256sum -c <file>.sha256` | Used in CI/CD and manual verification routines. |
| **Validation Schedule** | Per release (Quarterly) | Automatic verification during the FAIR+CARE audit cycle. |
| **Storage** | Immutable branch protection (`main`) | Prevents alteration of checksum history. |

---

## ⚙️ CI/CD Workflow Integration

**Workflow File:** `.github/workflows/icon-checksum-validate.yml`

**Automated Tasks**
1. Compute SHA-256 for all archived icons (`web/public/icons/app/nav/legacy/*.svg`)
2. Compare generated hashes against committed `.sha256` manifests  
3. Log verification outcomes to:
   - `reports/self-validation/web-icons-app-nav-legacy-checksums-validation.json`
   - `reports/audit/web-icons-faircare.json`
4. Report checksum anomalies to the Governance Ledger for remediation.

**Example CLI Check**
```bash
sha256sum -c icon-nav-home-v1.sha256
# Output: icon-nav-home-v1.svg: OK
```

## 🧾 Example Checksum Record

```text
9fdd2c53b5ccf6e234be12b3a719da32849b67df38aabb5b236ef9a1f5ad7c6b  icon-nav-home-v1.svg
```

*This confirms that `icon-nav-home-v1.svg` has not been modified since its archival date (2025-09-30).*

## 📊 Telemetry & Integrity Metrics

Telemetry reports record:
- ✅ Total checksum files validated  
- ⚠️ Mismatch events detected (if any)  
- 🧾 Audit hash verification rate (%)  
- 🔐 Archive immutability status  

These data feed into `releases/v9.5.0/focus-telemetry.json` and FAIR+CARE compliance dashboards.
