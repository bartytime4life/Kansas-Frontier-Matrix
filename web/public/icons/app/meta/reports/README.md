## üß© Report Types & Purpose

| Report File | Description | Generation Source |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **app-icons-metadata-report.json** | Consolidated summary of all metadata validation runs. | `.github/workflows/icon-meta-validate.yml` |
| **app-icons-accessibility-report.json** | Contains accessibility test results for icons (contrast, labeling). | `.github/workflows/icon-accessibility-validate.yml` |
| **app-icons-faircare-report.json** | Aggregated FAIR+CARE audit results across all app icon categories. | `.github/workflows/faircare-audit.yml` |
| **app-icons-governance-report.json** | Logs synchronization status between metadata and Governance Ledger. | `.github/workflows/ledger-sync.yml` |
| **validation-history.log** | Human-readable ledger of all past validations and audit events. | Generated via automation during each release cycle. |

All JSON reports are **machine-readable** and adhere to FAIR+CARE reporting standards for transparent validation tracking.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Automated Generation Workflows

### 1. `.github/workflows/icon-meta-validate.yml`
Validates JSON metadata for:
- Schema conformance (`schemas/ui/icons.schema.json`)
- Required field completeness
- SHA-256 checksum linkage
- FAIR+CARE field verification

### 2. `.github/workflows/icon-accessibility-validate.yml`
Runs automated WCAG 2.2 AA testing for color contrast, labeling, and icon visibility.

### 3. `.github/workflows/faircare-audit.yml`
Generates FAIR+CARE compliance reports evaluating:
- Metadata completeness  
- Provenance accuracy  
- Ethical authorship documentation  

### 4. `.github/workflows/ledger-sync.yml`
Cross-verifies Governance Ledger entries against validated metadata records for consistency.

## üìä FAIR+CARE Metrics in Reports

Each report includes the following quantitative measures:

| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| **F (Findable)** | % of icons discoverable via metadata | 100% |
| **A (Accessible)** | % of metadata accessible without barriers | 100% |
| **I (Interoperable)** | % of records aligned with schema.org & STAC | ‚â•95% |
| **R (Reusable)** | % of records with clear provenance & licensing | 100% |
| **CARE (Ethical)** | Ethical authorship & transparency score | ‚â•90% |

Reports also document:
- Audit timestamps  
- Total icons validated  
- Validation error summaries  
- Version history linkage  
- FAIR+CARE compliance index
