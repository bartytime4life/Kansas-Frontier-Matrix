# 🪝 **Kansas Frontier Matrix — Timeline Hooks Module (v2.1.1 · Tier-Ω+∞ Certified)**  
`web/src/features/timeline/hooks/README.md`

**Mission:** Provide reusable React hooks for **temporal state management, provenance linking, and AI synchronization**  
across the timeline visualization system of the **Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM)** — ensuring accessibility, ethical design,  
and FAIR+CARE-aligned provenance integrity.

## 📚 Overview

The **Timeline Hooks Module** manages temporal state, synchronization, and accessibility for all timeline interactions  
within the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM). It powers **event rendering**, **timeline zoom**, and **provenance sync** logic  
using lightweight React + TypeScript patterns validated under FAIR+CARE governance.

Each hook:
- Enables **deterministic data linkage** between the timeline and MapLibre layers.  
- Incorporates **FAIR+CARE metadata validation** for events and datasets.  
- Enforces **WCAG 2.1 AA** accessibility and ARIA compliance in interactive state changes.  
- Logs provenance data to the **Governance Ledger** for reproducibility and audit trails.

## 🧱 Core Hooks

| Hook | Description | FAIR+CARE Function | Validation Workflow |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **useTimelineState** | Manages timeline state (start, end, active range). | Findable + Accessible | `ui-validate.yml` |
| **useTimelineZoom** | Enables D3 zoom/pan with dynamic scale snapping. | Interoperable + Usability | `policy-check.yml` |
| **useProvenanceSync** | Synchronizes event selections with metadata & ledger. | Responsibility + Provenance | `faircare-validate.yml` |

---

## 🧠 FAIR + CARE Integration

| Principle | Implementation | Validation |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Findable** | Timeline state linked to dataset IDs in STAC/DCAT catalogs. | `stac-validate.yml` |
| **Accessible** | Full ARIA and keyboard navigation integrated in hooks. | `design-validate.yml` |
| **Interoperable** | Standardized state management across React ecosystem. | `policy-check.yml` |
| **Reusable** | Hooks shared across all timeline components. | `ui-validate.yml` |
| **Collective Benefit (CARE)** | Supports cultural and ethical representation in data playback. | `faircare-validate.yml` |

---

## ♿ Accessibility Standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)

| Feature | Implementation | Validation |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Keyboard Navigation** | Arrow keys adjust timeline range and zoom. | `ui-validate.yml` |
| **ARIA Roles** | `role="slider"` + `aria-valuetext` for temporal range. | `design-validate.yml` |
| **Screen Reader Support** | Timeline state changes announced dynamically. | `docs-validate.yml` |
| **Focus Management** | Active timeline range receives visible focus ring. | `design-validate.yml` |

---

## 🔍 Provenance & Governance Integration

| Artifact | Purpose | Path |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **STAC Items** | Temporal metadata linkage. | `data/stac/items/` |
| **DCAT Catalog** | Dataset registry and discoverability. | `data/meta/dcat_catalog.json` |
| **Governance Ledger** | Provenance checksum and audit validation. | `data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json` |

> Every timeline event logged by hooks includes a governance checksum and is validated during FAIR+CARE audits.

## 🧮 Observability Metrics

| Metric | Description | Target | Validation |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **Render Stability** | % of consistent timeline re-renders. | ≥ 95% | `ui-validate.yml` |
| **Metadata Link Validity** | Successful provenance linkage per event. | 100% | `stac-validate.yml` |
| **Accessibility Compliance** | Lighthouse or axe-core accessibility score. | ≥ 95 | `design-validate.yml` |
| **Ledger Sync Accuracy** | Ratio of valid governance ledger entries. | 100% | `governance-ledger.yml` |
