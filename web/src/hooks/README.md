# ü™ù **Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî Global React Hooks Library (v2.1.1 ¬∑ Tier-Œ©+‚àû Certified)**  
`web/src/hooks/README.md`

**Mission:** Provide a FAIR+CARE-aligned library of reusable React hooks that unify accessibility,  
governance, and ethical data handling throughout the **Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM)** web ecosystem.

## üìö Overview

The **Global Hooks Library** defines reusable, governance-aware logic for state management,  
event handling, provenance tracking, and accessibility.  
Each hook adheres to FAIR+CARE and WCAG principles, ensuring ethical, transparent,  
and accessible user interactions across the KFM platform.

Core objectives:
- ‚ôªÔ∏è Provide standardized, tested hooks for consistent UI/UX behavior.  
- üîó Enable FAIR+CARE compliance across stateful interactions.  
- üß† Integrate governance metadata and provenance tracking.  
- ‚ôø Maintain full accessibility through ARIA and WCAG alignment.

## üß± Core Hooks

| Hook | Description | FAIR+CARE Function | Validation Workflow |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **useAccessibility** | Provides focus, keyboard navigation, and ARIA utilities. | Accessibility + Ethics | `design-validate.yml` |
| **useGovernanceLedger** | Syncs UI interactions and data provenance to ledger. | Transparency + Responsibility | `governance-ledger.yml` |
| **useFairCareMetrics** | Tracks FAIR+CARE scores for data and interactions. | Accountability + Ethics | `faircare-validate.yml` |
| **useUIState** | Persists user settings and preferences across sessions. | Reusability + Inclusivity | `ui-validate.yml` |
| **useAPIFetch** | Wraps fetch calls with checksum and provenance registration. | Traceability + Transparency | `stac-validate.yml` |

---

## üß† FAIR + CARE Integration

| Principle | Implementation | Validation |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Findable** | Hook metadata documented and indexed in governance reports. | `policy-check.yml` |
| **Accessible** | ARIA-safe interaction utilities built into hooks. | `design-validate.yml` |
| **Interoperable** | Hooks written in TypeScript for reusability across modules. | `ui-validate.yml` |
| **Reusable** | Shared library integrated into all frontend modules. | `docs-validate.yml` |
| **Collective Benefit (CARE)** | Promotes inclusive, ethical, and explainable design logic. | `faircare-validate.yml` |

---

## ‚ôø Accessibility Standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)

| Feature | Implementation | Validation |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Keyboard Navigation** | Managed globally via `useAccessibility`. | `ui-validate.yml` |
| **Focus Management** | Tracks focus state and restores on modal/dialog close. | `ui-validate.yml` |
| **ARIA Roles** | Automatically applies ARIA attributes to interactive elements. | `design-validate.yml` |
| **Color Scheme Awareness** | Detects OS/system theme for contrast optimization. | `design-validate.yml` |

---

## üîç Provenance & Governance Integration

| Artifact | Description | Path |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Governance Ledger** | Records provenance data and checksums from hook activity. | `data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json` |
| **FAIR+CARE Ethics Report** | Summarizes inclusivity and compliance audits. | `data/reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json` |
| **Telemetry Schema** | Tracks interaction events and validation status. | `schemas/telemetry/web-hooks-schema.json` |

> üß© Hooks automatically log key governance and accessibility actions  
> to the ledger during CI/CD validation.

## üßÆ Observability Metrics

| Metric | Description | Target | Workflow |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **Hook Stability Index** | % of tests passing across environments. | ‚â• 95 | `ui-validate.yml` |
