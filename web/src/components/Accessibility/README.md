# ‚ôø **Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî Accessibility Components Library (v2.1.1 ¬∑ Tier-Œ©+‚àû Certified)**  
`web/src/components/Accessibility/README.md`

**Mission:** Deliver modular, reusable, and FAIR+CARE-aligned accessibility components  
for the **Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM)** web application, ensuring inclusivity, governance traceability,  
and WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across all user interface modules.

## üìö Overview

The **Accessibility Components Library** provides dedicated React components and utilities  
that enhance accessibility, usability, and inclusive design across the KFM platform.  
Each component is tested against **WCAG 2.1 AA**, **WAI-ARIA 1.2**, and **FAIR+CARE governance standards**,  
ensuring an equitable and transparent user experience.

Core objectives:
- ‚ôø Enable full accessibility for all users and assistive technologies.  
- üß≠ Maintain WCAG compliance through reusable components and hooks.  
- üîó Integrate FAIR+CARE ethics into accessibility behaviors.  
- üìä Log component validation and accessibility audits into governance ledger.
