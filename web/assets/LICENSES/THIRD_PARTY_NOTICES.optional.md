## ✅ Maintainer checklist

- [ ] When adding a new third‑party asset to `web/assets/`, add it to the **Asset inventory** table.
- [ ] Prefer adding `SOURCE.md` (where it came from) and/or a copy of the asset’s license text in `web/assets/LICENSES/`.
- [ ] Do not ship 🔒 assets in public releases unless you have redistribution rights.
- [ ] Audit 🧩 bundles before any public distribution.
