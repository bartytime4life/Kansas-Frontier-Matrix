# 🧾 Font License File (`LICENSE.txt`) — Template (KFM)

**Target path:** `web/assets/media/_sources/fonts/<family-slug>/<version>/LICENSE.txt`

This repo treats `web/assets/media/_sources/` as the **audit trail** for shipped assets (provenance + licensing). Fonts are “software” — if it’s not licensed + traceable, it doesn’t ship. ✅

## 🗂️ Folder context

```text
📁 web/assets/media/_sources/fonts/
└─ 📁 <family-slug>/
   └─ 📁 <version>/
      ├─ 📄 LICENSE.txt   ✅ (paste the upstream license verbatim here)
      ├─ 📄 SOURCE.yml    🧬 (provenance + checksums)
      ├─ 📄 upstream.zip  📦 (original download)
      ├─ 📄 SUBSET.md     ✂️ (only if you subset/transform)
      └─ 📁 derived/      ⚙️ (optional review outputs, e.g. woff2)
```

## ✅ Paste into `LICENSE.txt`

> 🧠 **Important:** This is a **placeholder template**.  
> Before a font is promoted/shipped, replace this entire template with the **exact upstream license text** (no edits).

TEMPLATE — REPLACE BEFORE SHIPPING
=================================

This file MUST contain the full, verbatim license text for the font(s) in this folder.

Family (display name): <REPLACE>
Family slug:           <family-slug>
Version:               <version>
Upstream source URL:   <REPLACE>
Upstream license name: <REPLACE>   (e.g., "SIL Open Font License 1.1", "Apache 2.0", "EULA", etc.)
Retrieved (UTC):       <REPLACE>   (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ)

RULES (KFM)
-----------
1) Replace this entire template with the upstream license text verbatim.
2) Do NOT modify license terms or wording.
3) If upstream ships multiple required notices (e.g., NOTICE, AUTHORS, COPYRIGHT),
   include them in this same version folder (keep original filenames if provided).
4) Ensure SOURCE.yml references this file in its "license_files" list and captures checksums.

--- BEGIN UPSTREAM LICENSE (PASTE VERBATIM BELOW THIS LINE) ---


--- END UPSTREAM LICENSE ---
```

## 🔒 Quick sanity checklist (before shipping)

- [ ] `LICENSE.txt` is **not** this template anymore (it’s the verbatim upstream license).
- [ ] `SOURCE.yml` exists and includes **upstream URL + version + checksums**.
- [ ] `upstream.zip` exists (preferred) and matches the recorded checksums.
- [ ] If subsetting/transforms occurred: `SUBSET.md` explains what changed + why.

✅ Done = traceable + compliant + KFM-grade.
