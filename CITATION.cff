abstract: >-
  Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM) is an open-source geospatial + historical knowledge
  platform (a living atlas of Kansas) that ingests heterogeneous sources, publishes
  governed metadata catalogs (STAC for spatial assets, DCAT for dataset/distribution
  discovery, PROV for lineage), builds a semantically structured knowledge graph, and
  serves evidence through contract-first APIs into a combined map-and-narrative UI.
  The canonical pipeline is ETL -> STAC/DCAT/PROV catalogs -> graph -> APIs -> UI ->
  Story Nodes -> Focus Mode, ensuring that every derived artifact and narrative claim is
  provenance-linked, reproducible, and auditable. Governance is aligned with FAIR+CARE
  principles and Trustworthy-AI constraints (human oversight, transparency, and
  protection against unsourced outputs or sensitive location leaks).
