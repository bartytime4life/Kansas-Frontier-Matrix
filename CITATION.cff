  For dataset-level reuse (derived layers, Story Nodes, models/outputs), cite the specific
  catalog record (DCAT dataset entry and/or STAC Item/Collection) so provenance, licensing,

abstract: >-
  Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM) is a provenance-first, governance-as-code living atlas for Kansas:
  a pipeline → catalog → database → API → UI system that transforms raw spatial and historical sources
  into vetted, explorable knowledge with STAC/DCAT metadata and W3C PROV lineage. KFM serves curated
  geospatial layers and narrative “Story Nodes” via governed endpoints for maps, tiles, timelines,
  dashboards, and citation-rich AI-assisted exploration (Focus Mode). Stewardship is designed to align
  with FAIR + CARE so open science and community value can coexist with traceability, access constraints,
  and Indigenous data governance considerations.
