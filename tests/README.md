# 🧪 **Kansas Frontier Matrix — Testing & QA Framework**
`tests/README.md`

**Purpose:**  
Unified FAIR+CARE-certified testing and quality assurance suite ensuring **reproducibility, ethics validation, and checksum lineage integrity** across all KFM systems.  
Implements continuous FAIR+CARE verification, schema compliance, and AI transparency testing under MCP-DL v6.3 and ISO 19115 frameworks.

## 📘 Overview

The **Testing & QA Framework** provides autonomous, reproducible testing for all ETL, AI, and governance layers within the Kansas Frontier Matrix.  
It guarantees ethics compliance, checksum validation, and FAIR+CARE audit readiness — empowering continuous certification across data workflows.

---

### Core Responsibilities:
- Validate pipelines for reproducibility and FAIR+CARE alignment.  
- Execute schema and checksum lineage verification tests.  
- Run AI explainability and drift validation audits.  
- Export test telemetry and governance synchronization reports.  
- Certify transparency across all MCP-DL operational layers.

## ⚙️ Test Workflow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
A["CI/CD Trigger or Commit Event"] --> B["Pytest Suite Execution (ETL + Schema + AI)"]
B --> C["Results Validation + FAIR+CARE Ethics Checks"]
C --> D["Checksum Verification + Provenance Logging"]
D --> E["Governance Ledger Sync + Telemetry Export"]
```

1. **Trigger:** Tests run automatically on PR, commit, or scheduled audit.  
2. **Validation:** Pytest executes FAIR+CARE, schema, and AI explainability tests.  
3. **Integrity:** Checksum lineage validated across source, processed, and archived data.  
4. **Governance:** QA outcomes registered to provenance ledger.  
5. **Telemetry:** Metrics exported for Focus Mode dashboards and sustainability reports.
