GOVERNED ARTIFACT NOTICE
FILE: README.md

This README is part of the KFM trust boundary. It defines non‑negotiable invariants, repo boundaries,
and the “truth path” from raw sources to user-facing claims.

If you change meaning (not just phrasing), route through the governance review path:
CODEOWNERS + required CI gates + Promotion Contract checks.

KFM rule: if a guarantee is not machine‑enforced (schemas + validators + CI wiring), treat it as NOT proven.

# Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM‑NG) 🧭🗺️  
### A governed, evidence‑first spatiotemporal knowledge system for Kansas

**KFM turns heterogeneous Kansas history + geospatial data into a trustable system:**  
**data → connectors + pipelines → receipts + catalogs → governed APIs → Map UI + Story Nodes + Focus Mode**

**KFM Principle:** *If it can’t be traced, it can’t be trusted.* 🔎

</div>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **What leadership should know (the “are we moving backwards?” answer):**  
> KFM is intentionally built **contract‑first** so we stop re‑building the same system every time a new dataset, story, or AI feature arrives.  
> Forward progress in KFM is measured by **enforcement loops**—schemas → validators → CI gates → runtime policy—because that is what prevents regression and rework.
>
> **A KFM win is a demo where a claim is clickable and provable:**  
> *Claim → citation → evidence view → (catalog + receipt + checksum) → raw source*.

## Start Here

### If you only read one section
Read **[KFM Constitution](#kfm-constitution)**. These are non‑negotiable.

### If you need to judge if we’re moving forward
Read **[How We Prove Progress](#how-we-prove-progress)**. That’s the scoreboard.

### If you’re building
Read **[Truth Path](#truth-path)** and **[Promotion Contract](#promotion-contract)**, then implement validators and CI wiring until the repo can **fail closed**.

> [!TIP]
> A governed system without a runnable verification harness is “paper governance.”  
> If there is no CI‑mirrored command like `make verify` (or equivalent), treat that as a **P0 gap**.

---

## What KFM Ships

KFM ships **governed outputs**—not just “data” and not just “a map.”

### 1) Governed datasets (servable truth)
- `data/processed/**` artifacts that are **promoted**
- checksums for every artifact
- catalogs/provenance that cross‑link: **DCAT + PROV required**, **STAC when spatial**

### 2) Governed narratives (Story Nodes)
- replayable map/time state
- citations that resolve via evidence resolver
- publish blocked if citations don’t resolve or policy denies

### 3) Governed Q&A (Focus Mode)
- returns **cited answer or abstains**
- **always** emits `audit_ref`
- uses only policy‑allowed evidence packs (no “free text guesses”)

---

## How We Prove Progress

This section exists to prevent the “we are moving backwards” perception. KFM progress is not measured by the number of pages of documentation. It’s measured by how many **closed loops** exist where the system can prove its own claims.

### The KFM proof ladder

| Level | What exists | What it proves | How you demo it |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 0 | **Docs only** | Intent (no guarantees) | “Here’s what we want” |
| 1 | Schemas + fixtures | Shapes are defined | validate a sample object |
| 2 | Validators + reports | Checks are executable | validator outputs JSON report |
| 3 | CI gates + branch protection | Checks are enforced | PR cannot merge if failing |
| 4 | Runtime policy + audit | Governance is on‑path | request denied/allowed with `audit_ref` |
| 5 | End‑to‑end evidence UX | Trust is user‑visible | click citation → evidence view |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> KFM does **not** claim progress based on “Level 0.”  
> We only claim progress when a guarantee reaches **Level 3+** (merge‑blocking), and ideally **Level 5** (clickable proof).

### Leadership demo script (10 minutes, no hand‑waving)

1) **Promote** one dataset version (raw → work → processed).  
2) Show the **receipt bundle** with `spec_hash` and checksums.  
3) Open **DCAT** (rights + distributions) and **PROV** (lineage).  
4) In UI/Story/Focus: click a citation and show the **evidence view**.  
5) Show the **audit event** referenced by `audit_ref`.

If we cannot do steps 1–5 for at least one domain, the project is incomplete—not failing, just incomplete.

## KFM Constitution

These invariants must remain true regardless of implementation details.

### Constitutional contracts (IDs for CI + incidents + ADRs)

| Contract ID | Invariant | Meaning | Minimum enforcement surface |
|---|---|---|---|
| **KFM‑C0** | Trust membrane | UI/external clients never access DBs/object storage directly | API-only access + network isolation |
| **KFM‑C1** | Fail closed | Missing inputs/proofs → deny or abstain | default‑deny policies + regression tests |
| **KFM‑C2** | Processed serves truth | Only processed + cataloged artifacts are served | API reads from processed catalogs only |
| **KFM‑C3** | Promotion Contract required | No promotion without receipts/checksums/catalogs | CI gate + schema validation |
| **KFM‑C4** | Deterministic identity | `spec_hash = sha256(JCS(spec))` (RFC 8785) | receipt validator + determinism tests |
| **KFM‑C5** | Evidence refs resolvable | Citations resolve via evidence resolver | resolver contract tests |
| **KFM‑C6** | Cite or abstain + audit_ref | Story/Focus must cite or abstain; always emit `audit_ref` | output validator + policy gate |
| **KFM‑C7** | Audit integrity | Append‑only audit events, integrity verifiable | ledger + checkpoints/hash chain |
| **KFM‑C8** | No silent redaction | Redaction/generalization is provenance‑tracked | derived outputs + PROV |
| **KFM‑C9** | Immutable releases | Releases are append‑only shipping records | release validator + checksum verify |
| **KFM‑C10** | Rights‑first publishing | Missing rights/license/access terms → deny promotion | DCAT required fields + promotion gate |

> [!WARNING]
> If any of these are weakened “for speed,” that is a governance incident—because it creates rework later.

---

## Architecture and Boundaries

KFM is a governed system with clean architecture layers.

### Clean layers (contract)
- **Domain layer:** pure entities/models (no DB/UI dependencies)
- **Use case/service layer:** workflows + business rules; calls only abstract interfaces
- **Integration/interface layer:** ports/contracts + adapters; repository interfaces + API boundaries
- **Infrastructure layer:** concrete implementations (PostGIS, object store, search/vector, graph, FastAPI, React/MapLibre/Cesium)

### Trust membrane (non‑negotiable)
- Frontend and external clients never access databases or object storage directly.
- Backend business logic never bypasses repository interfaces to talk directly to storage.
- All user-visible claims cross a **policy decision point**.

> [!NOTE]
> “We have a frontend” is not architecture. The trust membrane is architecture.

---

## Truth Path

There is only one allowed route to “servable truth.”

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  S[Sources] --> C[Connectors / Watchers]
  C --> RAW[data/raw<br/>immutable manifests + checksums]
  RAW --> RUN[Pipeline run]
  RUN --> WORK[data/work<br/>run_record + validation_report + run_manifest]
  WORK -->|Promotion Contract| PROC[data/processed<br/>servable artifacts + checksums]
  PROC --> CAT[Catalogs<br/>DCAT + PROV required<br/>STAC when spatial]
  CAT --> API[Governed API + Policy + Evidence Resolver]
  API --> UI[Map UI + Timeline]
  API --> STORY[Story Nodes]
  API --> FM[Focus Mode]
  API --> AUD[Audit ledger]
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Serving from `raw/` or `work/` is a trust failure. KFM serves truth from **processed + catalogs only**.

---

## Evidence and Citation Chain

The truth path explains how data is produced. The evidence chain explains how **claims** are allowed to exist.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  CLAIM[User-visible claim<br/>Story Node or Focus Mode] --> CIT[Citation object<br/>ref + label]
  CIT --> RES[Evidence resolver]
  RES --> VIEW[Evidence view<br/>bounded + UI-ready]
  VIEW --> LINKS[Cross-links<br/>DCAT/STAC/PROV + receipts]
  LINKS --> RAWREF[Raw manifest + checksums]
```

**Fail‑closed rule:** if any node in this chain is missing or denied → **do not publish / abstain**.

---

## Governed Artifact Inventory

This table answers: “What must exist for KFM to safely ship anything?”

| Artifact | Purpose | Canonical location | Served to users? | Required validation |
|---|---|---|---:|---|
| Dataset registry entry | license, cadence, sensitivity, contacts | `data/registry/` | ❌ | schema + policy checks |
| Raw manifest + checksums | immutable capture of upstream inputs | `data/raw/<dataset_id>/` | ❌ | checksum validation |
| Run receipts | prove what ran, with which inputs/outputs | `data/work/<dataset_id>/runs/<run_id>/` | ❌ | receipt schema |
| Validation report | quality + geometry + rights checks | same | ❌ | report schema + thresholds |
| Processed artifacts + checksums | publishable truth | `data/processed/<dataset_id>/<version_id>/` | ✅ | checksums + format validators |
| DCAT record | interoperable dataset catalog + rights | `data/catalog/dcat/` | ✅ | DCAT profile validation |
| STAC collections/items | spatiotemporal asset metadata | `data/catalog/stac/` | ✅ | STAC schema validation |
| PROV lineage | trace transformations | `data/catalog/prov/` | ✅ (bounded views) | PROV validation + cross-links |
| Evidence views | UI-ready proof behind citations | API output | ✅ | resolver contract tests |
| Story Nodes | narratives w/ citations + view state | `docs/reports/story_nodes/` | ✅ | schema + citation resolution |
| Focus Mode answers | grounded Q&A | API output | ✅ | cite‑or‑abstain validator |
| Audit events | prove governed actions happened | `audit/` (or external) | ✅ (`audit_ref`) | append‑only + integrity |
| Releases | immutable shipping record | `releases/` | ✅ | immutability + checksums |

---

## Promotion Contract

Promotion is the hard gate between “we processed something” and “we can serve it.”

### Promotion gate checklist (fail closed)

Promotion is denied unless **all** gates pass:

1) Raw capture: manifest + checksums exist  
2) Receipt bundle: `run_record` + `run_manifest` + `validation_report` validate  
3) Determinism: spec hashing + digests are stable  
4) Catalogs: DCAT + PROV exist; STAC exists when spatial  
5) Cross-links: catalogs ↔ receipts ↔ checksums are traversable end‑to‑end  
6) Rights: license/rights/access terms present (deny if missing)  
7) Sensitivity: classification present; generalization outputs exist when required  
8) Audit: promotion event emitted; `audit_ref` recorded  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Promotion is not “copy a file to processed.” Promotion is **provable publication**.

### Receipt bundle (illustrative minimum)

```json
{
  "dataset_id": "kfm_example_dataset",
  "run_id": "run_01J0EXAMPLE",
  "version_id": "v_2026_02_16_001",
  "spec_hash": "sha256:...",
  "inputs": [{"uri":"raw://.../manifest.yml","sha256":"..."}],
  "outputs": [{"path":"data/processed/.../out.parquet","sha256":"..."}],
  "catalogs": {
    "dcat": "data/catalog/dcat/kfm_example_dataset.json",
    "prov": "data/catalog/prov/kfm_example_dataset/run_run_01J0EXAMPLE.json",
    "stac": "data/catalog/stac/kfm_example_dataset/collection.json"
  },
  "validation_report": "data/work/.../validation_report.json"
}
```

---

## Story Nodes

Story Nodes are governed narrative artifacts that synchronize map/time state and citations.

### Story Node publishing contract
- must validate against schema
- every citation resolves via evidence resolver
- publish blocked on unresolvable citations or policy denial
- includes view/timeline state for replay

### Minimal Story Node (illustrative)

```yaml
story_id: story_kansas_railroads_001
version: 1
status: draft # draft|published
title: "Railroads and Town Growth in Kansas"
summary: "A guided narrative connecting rail lines, settlements, and census change over time."
audience: public # public|classroom|research
steps:
  - id: step_01
    title: "The first corridors"
    view_state:
      time_range: ["1865-01-01", "1875-12-31"]
      bbox: [-102.05, 36.99, -94.59, 40.00]
      layers: ["rail_lines_1870", "towns_1870"]
    narrative_md: |
      Rail expansion accelerated settlement along corridors. [^1]
    citations:
      - ref: "prov://..."
        label: "Rail lines (source + processing lineage)"
```

---

## Focus Mode

Focus Mode is KFM’s grounded Q&A surface.

### Response envelope (required)

```json
{
  "answer_markdown": "…",
  "citations": [{"ref":"prov://…","label":"…"}],
  "audit_ref": "audit://event/…"
}
```

### Cite‑or‑abstain (non‑negotiable)
- If evidence pack is empty → abstain  
- If policy denies required evidence → abstain  
- If citations cannot resolve → abstain  
- If sensitivity requires generalization and it’s not available → abstain  

> [!WARNING]
> Focus Mode must never “fill in” missing evidence with plausible text.

---

## Policy and Audit

### Policy decision point (PDP)
Policy is on‑path in CI and runtime.

Policy must decide (minimum):
- can this actor access this dataset/version?
- can we return precise coordinates (or must we generalize)?
- can Story Nodes be published?
- can Focus Mode answer (or must it abstain)?
- can promotion occur (receipts/catalogs/checksums valid)?

**Default deny** is mandatory.

### Audit ledger
- append‑only writes
- every governed response returns `audit_ref`
- audit events store references, not sensitive payloads

> [!IMPORTANT]
> No audit, no answer.

---

## Security, Rights, and Sensitivity

### Rights‑first publishing (KFM‑C10)
- Missing rights/license/access terms → **deny promotion**
- DCAT must carry rights fields (profiled)

### Sensitivity handling (KFM‑C8)
If a dataset contains sensitive or culturally restricted locations:
- serve generalized representations (coarse grids, heatmaps, region summaries)
- track transforms as provenance (no silent redaction)
- block raw coordinates unless policy explicitly allows

### Repo security baseline (expected)
- secret scanning + push protection enabled
- workflow hardening: pinned actions, least privilege
- dependency review on governance surfaces
- rate limits and non‑leaky errors on evidence resolver and AI endpoints

---

## Repo Layout

> [!IMPORTANT]
> One canonical home per subsystem. If your repo differs, document the mapping and keep the boundary identical.

```text
repo-root/
├─ .github/                     # governance + CI gatehouse (required)
├─ policy/                      # policy-as-code + tests (default deny)
├─ contracts/                   # schemas: receipts, catalogs, citations, APIs (or /schemas)
├─ data/                        # raw/work/processed + catalogs

└─ releases/                    # append-only shipping records
```

## Thin-Slice Roadmap

KFM advances by shipping **thin slices** that close enforcement loops.

### Slice 0 — Verification harness (stop paper governance)
- add validators + a single command that mirrors CI (`make verify` or equivalent)
- wire merge‑blocking CI jobs for: docs, contracts, policy, receipts, catalogs

### Slice 1 — One “anchor dataset” end‑to‑end
- pick a dataset with clear rights
- implement raw→work→processed + receipts + DCAT/PROV (STAC if spatial)
- demo click‑through evidence

### Slice 2 — Evidence resolver contract
- implement resolver schemes: `prov://`, `stac://`, `dcat://`, `doc://`, `graph://`
- contract test: resolve in ≤ 2 calls

### Slice 3 — Story Node schema + publish gate
- schema validation + citation resolution in CI
- playback smoke test (minimal)

### Slice 4 — Focus Mode minimal cited Q&A
- evidence packs bounded and auditable
- cite‑or‑abstain output validator
- audit ledger integration

> [!NOTE]
> This ordering is intentionally “boring first” because it prevents rework later.

---

## Definition of Done

### DoD — Add a dataset family
- [ ] registry entry exists (rights + sensitivity + cadence)
- [ ] raw capture produces immutable manifest + checksums
- [ ] pipeline produces receipts + validation report
- [ ] processed outputs have checksums
- [ ] DCAT + PROV validate; STAC validates if spatial
- [ ] cross-links validate end‑to‑end
- [ ] policy classification present; generalization outputs exist if needed
- [ ] evidence resolver resolves representative refs
- [ ] CI gates are merge‑blocking for the above

### DoD — Add/update a Story Node
- [ ] schema validates
- [ ] every citation resolves
- [ ] sensitivity labels correct
- [ ] publish blocked on any citation failure or policy deny
- [ ] playback smoke test exists

### DoD — Change policy
- [ ] change preserves default‑deny safety
- [ ] policy tests updated; at least one new negative test added
- [ ] CI and runtime policy bundle parity preserved (no drift)
