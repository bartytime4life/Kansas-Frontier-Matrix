# 📡 Kansas Frontier Matrix — **Telemetry Pipelines**
`src/pipelines/telemetry/README.md`

**Purpose:**  
Implements **real-time monitoring, environmental impact tracking, and Focus Mode telemetry** pipelines for the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
These pipelines capture system performance, FAIR+CARE ethics metrics, and sustainability data to ensure transparent, traceable, and energy-efficient governance.

## 📚 Overview

The **Telemetry Pipelines** record all operational and environmental metrics generated by KFM’s ETL, AI, and governance systems.  
They support **Focus Mode dashboards**, FAIR+CARE ethics audits, and ISO-aligned sustainability analytics through real-time monitoring and quarterly reporting.

### Core Responsibilities:
- Capture performance, energy, and FAIR+CARE compliance metrics.  
- Monitor system telemetry for pipeline and AI performance optimization.  
- Track energy usage and carbon footprint per workflow execution.  
- Register sustainability data in governance ledgers and Focus Mode dashboards.  
- Automate reporting under ISO 50001 and MCP-DL v6.3 energy compliance standards.

    D --> E["Focus Mode Dashboard Visualization"]
```

### Workflow Summary:
1. **Collection:** Monitors runtime performance, checksum audits, and AI energy usage.  
2. **Analysis:** Evaluates sustainability and ethics scores for FAIR+CARE audits.  
3. **Governance Sync:** Registers telemetry data in blockchain-ledger governance systems.  
4. **Focus Mode:** Displays insights in real time within the KFM web dashboard.
