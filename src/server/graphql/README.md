## 🧩 Why GraphQL in KFM
GraphQL exists here to:
- 🔎 Enable **semantic traversal** across KFM’s core entities (e.g., `Person → Event → Place → Dataset`) without the UI needing bespoke endpoints for every narrative path.
- 🗺️ Provide a single **contract** for the Web UI’s map/story experiences and the AI system’s evidence retrieval.
- 🧱 Enforce KFM’s core architecture rule: **the UI and clients never talk directly to Neo4j/PostGIS** — they go through governed APIs (REST + GraphQL).

## 🗺️ Big Picture Architecture

  Raw[📥 Raw Inputs] --> Triplet[🧾 STAC + DCAT + PROV]
  Triplet --> Stores[🕸️ Neo4j + 🌍 PostGIS]

  REST --> UI
```

---

## ✅ Non‑negotiables
These rules are *contract-level invariants* for this folder:

1. **No stage skipping** 🚫  
   Raw inputs must become the **evidence triplet** (STAC/DCAT/PROV) *before* they become graph entities.  
2. **No DB bypass** 🧱  
   UI/clients must not query Neo4j/PostGIS directly; GraphQL/REST are the enforcement boundary.
3. **No “mystery nodes”** 🕵️‍♂️❌  
   Every returned entity must be attributable to catalog/provenance (and ideally expose pointers).
4. **CARE/FAIR governance is not optional** 🤝  
   Sensitivity markings (e.g., `care_label`) must flow through schema + resolvers + policy gates.

## 📂 Folder Layout
> This is the **recommended** organization for `src/server/graphql/`. If your implementation is code-first vs SDL-first, adapt the exact filenames (but keep the responsibilities).

## 📜 Schema Contract

### 🧱 Core entities (KFM “spine”)
The core graph contract should be built around these types:

- 👤 **Person**
- 📍 **Place** (including geometry / bbox)
- 🗓️ **Event** (time-bounded, linked to place/person/datasets)
- 📦 **Dataset** (catalog-backed; resolvers must expose provenance pointers)

### 🧾 Provenance-first fields
Every “real” entity type should expose:
- `provenance` (pointers to **STAC/DCAT/PROV** artifacts)
- `careLabel` / sensitivity marker (for governance + redaction)
- stable `id` (used across catalogs + graph + UI)

Suggested shape (illustrative):

```graphql
type ProvenanceRefs {
  stacItemId: ID
  dcatDatasetId: ID
  provBundleId: ID
  # Optional: signed artifact digests for packaged distributions (PMTiles/GeoParquet/COG)
  artifactDigests: [String!]
}

enum CareLabel {
  public
  restricted
  culturally_sensitive
}

interface KfmEntity {
  id: ID!
  label: String
  provenance: ProvenanceRefs!
  careLabel: CareLabel!
}
```

### 📄 Story Nodes (narrative layer)
Story Nodes are treated as first-class objects that combine:
- ✍️ **Markdown narrative**
- 🧭 **Map/timeline state config** (JSON)
- 🔗 **Citations** (human-readable) + **evidence manifest** (machine-verifiable)

Suggested shape:

```graphql
type StoryNode {
  id: ID!
  slug: String!
  title: String!
  markdown: String!
  config: JSON!
  citations: [Citation!]!
  evidenceManifestRef: String # e.g., EM-84.yaml
  provenance: ProvenanceRefs!
  careLabel: CareLabel!
}

type Citation {
  key: String!      # e.g., "1"
  label: String!    # e.g., "1908 newspaper clipping..."
  url: String
  checksum: String
}
```

## ⚙️ Resolver & Data Access Patterns

### 🧠 Data sources (expected)
Resolvers typically federate data from:
- 🧠 **Neo4j** for relationship traversal and conceptual graph structure  
- 🌍 **PostGIS** for spatial filtering, geometry operations, and map-layer queries  
- 🧾 **Catalog triplet** (STAC/DCAT/PROV) for evidence + metadata integrity  
- 📦 **Artifact registry/storage** for packaged data (PMTiles, GeoParquet, COGs), ideally content-addressed + signed

### 🧯 Guardrails (required)
GraphQL must protect the system from expensive queries:
- ✅ Depth limit / recursion guard
- ✅ Query complexity scoring
- ✅ Pagination required for collections (no unbounded lists)
- ✅ Rate limiting / per-role quotas (implementation-specific)
- ✅ Batching to avoid N+1 (DataLoader pattern)

> Rule of thumb: if the query *can* explode combinatorially, it *will*.

### 🧵 Resolver checklist
When adding/changing a resolver:
1. **Does it return provenance pointers?** (`STAC/DCAT/PROV`)  
2. **Does it enforce `care_label` / sensitivity?**  
3. **Is it paginated + filterable?**  
4. **Is it batched/cached?**  
5. **Is it covered by policy tests + unit tests?**

---

## 🌎 Geospatial + Temporal Querying

### 🧭 Common filters
Design spatial queries around:
- `bbox` (minLon, minLat, maxLon, maxLat)
- `geometry` (Polygon/MultiPolygon)
- `timeRange` (start/end; supports timeline slider + narratives)

Example “events in space + time” query (illustrative):

```graphql
query EventsInBbox($bbox: BBoxInput!, $time: TimeRangeInput!) {
  events(bbox: $bbox, time: $time, first: 50) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        name
        date
        place { id name geometry }
        provenance { stacItemId dcatDatasetId provBundleId }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 🗺️ Output formats
Prefer:
- `GeoJSON` scalar for features/collections
- typed geometries for UI-friendly rendering
- “artifact refs” for high-volume map layers (PMTiles/COGs), not raw features

---

## 📖 Story Nodes + Evidence Manifests

### ✅ Why this matters
Story Nodes are not “just markdown pages.” In KFM they are:
- **queryable narrative objects**
- backed by **citations** + **evidence manifests**
- connected into the provenance graph (PROV)

### 🧾 Story Node front-matter (illustrative)
```markdown
---
id: story.dust-bowl.1935
title: "Dust Bowl: 1935"
year: 1935
care_label: public
evidence_manifest: "EM-84.yaml"
map:
  camera: { lon: -99.5, lat: 38.5, zoom: 6.2 }
layers:
  - "layer.drought-index"
  - "layer.county-boundaries"
---
# Dust Bowl: 1935
...narrative text...
```

### 🔌 GraphQL responsibilities for Story Nodes
- Provide the **renderable narrative** (`markdown`)
- Provide the **state config** (`config`) to drive UI (map/layers/timeline)
- Provide **citations + manifest references** for “View Evidence”
- Provide **graph connections**: `relatedDatasets`, `relatedPlaces`, `relatedEvents`, etc.

---

## 🤖 Focus Mode (AI) Integration
Focus Mode is only trustworthy if it can:
- pull **graph-grounded context**
- cite **verifiable evidence**
- obey governance constraints (`care_label`, role-based access)

GraphQL’s job in that loop:
- Provide **safe, bounded** retrieval endpoints (subgraph slices, dataset summaries, provenance pointers)
- Return **citation-ready references** (STAC/DCAT/PROV + evidence manifests)

> 🧠 Keep “AI text generation” separate from “evidence retrieval.” GraphQL should be the *retrieval contract*.

---

## 📦 Artifacts + Offline Packs

KFM supports (or is designed to support) **offline packs** and **field kit** scenarios:
- PMTiles / GeoParquet / COG bundles for offline usage
- digests/hashes for reproducibility
- signatures for supply-chain trust

GraphQL should expose “artifact manifest” metadata rather than streaming huge binaries:

```graphql
type ArtifactRef {
  kind: String!          # pmtiles | geoparquet | cog | model | ...
  uri: String!           # storage or registry locator
  digest: String!        # content hash
  mediaType: String!
  signatures: [Signature!]!
}

type Signature {
  kind: String!          # cosign | x509 | ...
  issuer: String
  subject: String
  verified: Boolean!
}
```

---

## 🔐 Governance, Security, and Privacy

### 🛡️ Policy-as-code
Expect policy enforcement to be done via:
- OPA/Rego policy pack
- CI gating (fail-closed)
- Runtime checks (directives/middleware) for field-level authorization

### 🧬 Sensitivity and `care_label`
**care_label** is a *data contract*, not an annotation:
- It impacts what fields can be returned
- It may require geometry fuzzing/redaction
- It must be enforced consistently across resolvers

### 🕵️ Query auditing & inference safety
GraphQL should emit auditable events (who queried what) and prevent inference leakage via:
- role-based restrictions
- throttling
- aggregation controls (where needed)

---

## 🧪 Testing + Quality Gates

### ✅ Required test layers
- **Schema compilation / type checks**
- **Resolver unit tests** (Neo4j/PostGIS adapters mocked or test containers)
- **Contract tests** for key UI operations (Map + Story + Focus)
- **Policy tests** (OPA/Rego + conftest)
- **Graph integrity checks** (orphan detection, missing provenance pointers, broken IDs)

### 🧾 Definition of Done (DoD) ✅
- [ ] New fields are documented + have example query
- [ ] Pagination enforced where applicable
- [ ] Provenance pointers included (STAC/DCAT/PROV)
- [ ] care_label honored (and tested)
- [ ] Policy tests added/updated
- [ ] Complexity/depth impact reviewed

---

## 🚧 Roadmap Hooks
This module should stay extendable for:
- 🔔 **Subscriptions / WebSockets** (live layers, streaming updates)
- 🧠 **Conceptual Attention Nodes** (theme hubs used by AI + UI)
- 🧵 **Pulse Threads** (micro-stories with evidence, shareable across federated instances)
- 🧪 **Narrative Pattern Detection** (detectors → narrative templates → evidence)
- 🕶️ **AR / Digital Twin overlays** (anchors, time travel, 4D views)
