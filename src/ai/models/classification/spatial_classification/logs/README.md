# 🧾 **Kansas Frontier Matrix — Spatial Classification · Training Logs**  
`src/ai/models/classification/spatial_classification/logs/README.md`

**Purpose:**  
Document all **training, validation, and sustainability logs** generated by **Spatial Classification models** within the **Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM)**.  
These logs ensure transparency, fairness, sustainability, and **FAIR+CARE** certification, including performance, bias metrics, and carbon footprint tracking.

## 📘 Overview

The **Spatial Classification Training Logs** archive performance and operational metrics for models used to classify geospatial data (e.g., landcover, hydrology, terrain).  
These logs support **FAIR+CARE governance**, **ISO 50001 sustainability tracking**, and **bias/fairness audits**, ensuring responsible AI decision-making in the Kansas Frontier Matrix.

Key Features:
- 🔍 **Training performance logs** including loss curves, accuracy, and F1 score.  
- ⚖️ **Bias and fairness analysis** to ensure equal representation of spatial features.  
- ♻️ **Sustainability tracking** to monitor energy consumption and carbon footprint (ISO 50001).  
- 🧾 **FAIR+CARE governance logs** for audit and certification.

## ⚙️ Logging Workflow

  A["Spatial Data (DEM · NDVI · Hydro · Soil)"] --> B["Model Training (CNN / ViT)"]
  B --> C["Validation (Accuracy · Spatial Consistency)"]
  C --> D["Bias & Fairness Audit (FAIR+CARE)"]
  D --> E["Telemetry Logging (Energy · Carbon · Runtime)"]
  E --> F["Governance Certification (FAIR+CARE)"]
  F --> G["Model Integration (Focus Mode · Knowledge Graph)"]
```

### Workflow Breakdown:
1. **Training Metrics:** Logs model performance, loss, and accuracy across epochs.  
2. **Evaluation Metrics:** Summarizes validation results, such as F1 score and spatial alignment.  
3. **Bias & Fairness Audit:** Identifies drift in model predictions and ensures fairness across geospatial regions.  
4. **Telemetry Logging:** Tracks energy, runtime, and carbon emissions during model training.  
5. **Governance Certification:** FAIR+CARE Council certifies the model’s ethical and sustainability compliance.
