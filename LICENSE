Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM) — Repository Licensing
==================================================

Default license (KFM-authored, non-code content)
------------------------------------------------
Unless otherwise noted, the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM) documentation, Story Nodes, templates,
schemas, and other original non-code content in this repository are licensed under the Creative
Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC BY 4.0).

KFM’s artifact-level licensing model (how to determine the governing license)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
KFM is designed to track provenance and usage constraints at the artifact level (not just repo-wide).
Licensing should be captured and discovered alongside evidence metadata wherever possible:

- Documents: a YAML front matter `license:` field (if present) governs that document.
- Datasets / assets: a `license` field in STAC or DCAT metadata (or the equivalent license field in
  the adopted DCAT serialization/profile) governs that dataset/asset/distribution.
- Third-party material: governed by its original license and attribution requirements.

License precedence (highest to lowest)
--------------------------------------
If multiple license signals exist, apply the first one that exists:

1) Explicit per-file license header / SPDX identifier (if present)
2) YAML front matter `license:` (governed docs, including Story Nodes)
3) STAC metadata license field
4) DCAT metadata license field
5) Third-party license/credit lines bundled with the source material
6) Repository default for KFM-authored non-code content (CC BY 4.0)

Path-based guidance (non-normative convenience)
-----------------------------------------------
These are convenience hints based on KFM’s canonical directory layout. Always prefer the
artifact-level license signals above.

- docs/** : governed docs + Story Nodes -> CC BY 4.0 unless overridden by YAML front matter.
- data/stac/**, data/catalog/dcat/**, data/prov/** : catalog/provenance artifacts -> governed by the
  license recorded in the corresponding STAC/DCAT record.
- data/raw/** and any externally sourced files anywhere -> governed by the original source license.

Software / code notice
----------------------
This repository may also contain software (e.g., src/**, web/**, tools/**, tests/**). CC BY 4.0 is the
default for non-code content only. Software code must be covered by an explicit software license
and/or per-file SPDX identifiers; if you do not see one, do not assume reuse rights.

Third-party material (externally sourced)
-----------------------------------------
Third-party material (e.g., externally sourced text, images, scans, datasets) is governed by its
original license and attribution requirements. Where possible, KFM records these obligations in
STAC/DCAT metadata and provenance logs so downstream users can comply.

Attribution requirements (CC BY 4.0)
------------------------------------
You may share (copy and redistribute) and adapt (remix, transform, and build upon) CC BY 4.0
material for any purpose, provided you give appropriate attribution and indicate if changes were
made.

For datasets and assets, follow the attribution and citation instructions recorded in STAC/DCAT
metadata and the referenced original sources.

Governance note (license + provenance review)
---------------------------------------------
New external data sources are a governance review trigger and must include explicit license and
source attribution in STAC/DCAT metadata before being used in Story Nodes or surfaced via APIs.
