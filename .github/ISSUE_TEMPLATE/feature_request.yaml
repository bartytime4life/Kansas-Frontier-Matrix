        ## 💡 Kansas Frontier Matrix — Feature Request Form  
        Use this form to suggest new functionality, UI improvements, pipeline features, or AI/ETL enhancements.  
        All feature proposals are reviewed during the **MCP Quarterly Architecture Review Cycle** and must include clear rationale and implementation details.

  - type: input
    id: feature_title
    attributes:
      label: "Feature Title"
      description: "Provide a short and descriptive title for the requested feature."
      placeholder: "e.g. Add AI-assisted entity linking for treaty documents"
    validations:
      required: true

  - type: textarea
    id: feature_summary
    attributes:
      label: "Summary"
      description: "Briefly summarize the purpose and scope of this feature."
      placeholder: |
        Example:
        This feature adds an NLP-based entity linking module that automatically connects people, places, and treaties
        within the Kansas Frontier Matrix knowledge graph.
    validations:
      required: true

  - type: textarea
    id: problem_statement
    attributes:
      label: "Problem or Opportunity"
      description: "Describe the problem this feature solves or the opportunity it creates."
      placeholder: |
        Example:
        Manual linking of historical entities is time-consuming and inconsistent.
        Automating entity relationships improves accuracy and discoverability across datasets.
    validations:
      required: true

  - type: textarea
    id: proposed_solution
    attributes:
      label: "Proposed Solution"
      description: "Explain your proposed implementation, including technologies, algorithms, or UI concepts."
      placeholder: |
        Example:
        Implement a `focus_transformer_v2` model in `src/ai/models/` that uses transformer embeddings
        to detect and link semantic entities. Integrate with Neo4j graph database via Cypher query templates.
    validations:
      required: true

        ### 🧭 Architecture Review & Validation Workflow  
        Submitted feature requests automatically enter KFM’s governance workflow:
        - **`docs-lint.yml`** → Validates proposal format and Markdown consistency  
        - **`stac-validate.yml`** → Checks metadata interoperability (if applicable)  
        - **`faircare-validate.yml`** → Confirms ethical compliance for any new datasets  
        - **`build-and-deploy.yml`** → (Triggered post-approval) integrates into development build  

        Approved proposals are tracked in:
        ```
        reports/audit/github-workflows-ledger.json
        ```
        and referenced in:
        ```
        releases/v9.7.0/focus-telemetry.json
        ```
