        ## 💡 Kansas Frontier Matrix — Feature Request Form
        Use this form to suggest new functionality, UI improvements, data/ETL features, or AI/graph enhancements.
        All feature proposals are reviewed under **MCP-DL v6.3**, **KFM-MDP v11.2.5**, **FAIR+CARE**, and KFM governance.

        This template is part of the deterministic KFM pipeline:

        `Deterministic ETL → STAC/DCAT/PROV catalogs → Neo4j knowledge graph → API layer → React/MapLibre/Cesium frontend → Story Nodes → Focus Mode`.

  - type: input
    id: feature_title
    attributes:
      label: "Feature Title"
      description: "Short, descriptive title for the requested feature."
      placeholder: "e.g. Add AI-assisted entity linking for treaty documents"
    validations:
      required: true

  - type: textarea
    id: feature_summary
    attributes:
      label: "Summary"
      description: "Summarize the purpose and scope of this feature."
      placeholder: |
        Example:
        This feature adds an NLP-based entity linking module that automatically connects
        people, places, and treaties within the Kansas Frontier Matrix knowledge graph.
    validations:
      required: true

  - type: textarea
    id: problem_statement
    attributes:
      label: "Problem or Opportunity"
      description: "Describe the problem this feature solves or the opportunity it enables."
      placeholder: |
        Example:
        Manual linking of historical entities is time-consuming and inconsistent.
        Automating these relationships improves accuracy and discoverability across datasets.
    validations:
      required: true

  - type: textarea
    id: proposed_solution
    attributes:

      placeholder: |
        Example:
        Implement an entity-linking module under `src/ai/models/` that uses transformer-based embeddings
        to detect and link semantic entities (people, places, events). Expose results via an API endpoint
        and integrate with Focus Mode and Neo4j through Cypher query templates.

        Examples:
        - Uses Indigenous or culturally sensitive data → requires sovereignty / CARE review.
        - New ML model may introduce or amplify bias; needs evaluation and documentation.

        ## 🧭 Architecture Review & Validation Workflow

        Feature requests help guide roadmap and architecture decisions. After submission, automation may:

        - Run **docs-validate.yml** to ensure the proposal and follow-up docs conform to **KFM-MDP v11.2.5**.  
        - Run **stac-validate.yml** / **dcat-validate.yml** if new metadata patterns, catalogs, or datasets are proposed.  
        - Run **faircare-validate.yml** to flag FAIR+CARE and sovereignty implications, especially for data- or AI-related features.  
        - Run **security_audit.yml** if the feature touches authentication, authorization, or supply-chain sensitive components.  
        - Feed into **telemetry_export.yml** for governance and roadmap telemetry (e.g., feature backlog, complexity, sustainability metrics).  

        Architecture and governance decisions are recorded in:

        `docs/reports/audit/github-workflows-ledger.json`

        Telemetry snapshots are typically stored in:

        `releases/<version>/focus-telemetry.json`  
        `docs/reports/telemetry/`

        Thank you for helping shape the **Kansas Frontier Matrix**.
        Your proposal contributes to a transparent, ethical, reproducible, and sovereign-aware system.
