## üìö Overview

This directory defines all GitHub **Issue Templates** used for structured collaboration, reproducible bug tracking, data submissions, governance audits, and ethical reviews.  
Each template enforces KFM‚Äôs **FAIR+CARE-aligned reporting structure**, ensuring that issues are logged with full metadata, provenance, and compliance details.

Templates include:
- üêõ **Bug Report** ‚Äî For technical, validation, or data pipeline issues.  
- üí° **Feature Request** ‚Äî For proposing enhancements or new integrations.  
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Governance Review** ‚Äî For ethical, FAIR+CARE, or documentation reviews.  
- üß≠ **Data Submission** ‚Äî For submitting new datasets, ETL sources, or schema updates.  

All issues automatically integrate into GitHub Actions workflows (`.github/workflows/`) for validation, tagging, and provenance logging.

## üß© Issue Templates Summary

| Template | Purpose | Required Fields | Workflow Link |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| `bug_report.yml` | Report bugs in ETL, AI, or UI workflows | Steps to reproduce, environment info, logs | `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` |
| `feature_request.yml` | Propose new features, data layers, or visualization tools | Rationale, implementation plan, dependencies | `.github/workflows/site.yml` |
| `governance_review.yml` | Request ethical or FAIR+CARE board reviews | FAIR+CARE metadata, risk assessment | `.github/workflows/faircare-validate.yml` |
| `data_submission.yml` | Submit new datasets or schema changes | Source, license, spatial coverage, metadata links | `.github/workflows/stac-validate.yml` |

---

## üß† FAIR+CARE Governance Fields

All issue templates include the following **required governance fields**:

| Field | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Dataset Source` | Original dataset name or API endpoint. |
| `License / Access Rights` | Legal terms and open-access status. |
| `Ethical Review Status` | ‚ÄúPending‚Äù, ‚ÄúApproved‚Äù, or ‚ÄúN/A‚Äù. |
| `Metadata File` | Linked STAC or JSON schema reference. |
| `Reviewer` | Responsible FAIR+CARE board member. |

> **Note:** The governance metadata collected through issues populates the provenance ledger (`reports/audit/ai_hazards_ledger.json`) and FAIR compliance reports (`reports/fair/`).

---

## üßæ Governance & Provenance Integration

All issue forms automatically link to:
- `docs/standards/governance/ROOT-GOVERNANCE.md`
- `data/stac/` for metadata traceability
- `reports/audit/` for provenance chain logging
- `releases/v9.3.2/focus-telemetry.json` for Focus Mode integration

Upon issue submission, GitHub Actions:
1. Validate metadata syntax.  
2. Trigger FAIR+CARE compliance check.  
3. Generate audit logs and hash verifications.  
4. Notify relevant maintainers or governance board members.

---

## üß© FAIR+CARE Compliance

FAIR Principles:
- **Findable:** Issues and metadata are categorized and indexed by type and domain.  
- **Accessible:** All templates use open GitHub YAML format and require public documentation links.  
- **Interoperable:** Metadata aligns with STAC/DCAT standards.  
- **Reusable:** Issues serve as reproducible provenance records for project decisions.  

CARE Principles:
- **Collective Benefit:** Encourages open community contribution with ethical oversight.  
- **Authority to Control:** Maintains project governance via designated reviewers.  
- **Responsibility:** Ensures contributors document data sensitivity and usage ethics.  
- **Ethics:** Governance templates enforce compliance with KFM‚Äôs ethical standards.
