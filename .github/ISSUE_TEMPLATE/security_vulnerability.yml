        ## 🔒 Kansas Frontier Matrix — Security Vulnerability Report (FAIR+CARE Certified)
        Use this confidential form to report a potential vulnerability or data exposure risk within the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
        All reports are reviewed privately by the FAIR+CARE Security Council under the MCP-DL v6.3 ethical governance framework.

        ⚠️ **Important:** Do not publicly disclose sensitive security details.  
        Reports are triaged confidentially and follow FAIR+CARE’s Responsible Disclosure Policy.
