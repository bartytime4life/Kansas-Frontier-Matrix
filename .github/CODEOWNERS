# Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM) — CODEOWNERS
#
# IMPORTANT
# - Replace the placeholder @kfm-* owners below with your real GitHub usernames and/or org teams.
# - CODEOWNERS works best paired with branch protection that requires CODEOWNER reviews.
#
# Role mapping (from KFM baseline governance roles):
# - @kfm-stewards: Reviewer/Steward (policy labels, redaction rules, promotion + publish approvals)
# - @kfm-operators: Operator (pipelines + deployments; cannot override policy gates)
#
# Quick-start option:
# - If you don’t have teams yet, temporarily replace every @kfm-* with a single trusted team/user,
#   then refine path-by-path.

# Default owners (everything not matched below)
* @kfm-maintainers
