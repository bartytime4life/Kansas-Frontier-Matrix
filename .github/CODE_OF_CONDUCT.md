## 🤝 Our Standards

- Be respectful and inclusive — no harassment or discrimination  
- Assume good intent; provide constructive feedback  
- Accept critique gracefully; disagree without hostility  
- Collaborate openly and transparently  
- Recognize contributions from all community members  

---

## 🚫 Unacceptable Behavior

- Harassment, insults, or derogatory comments  
- Discriminatory language or exclusionary behavior  
- Public or private intimidation, stalking, or threats  
- Disruptive trolling or deliberate derailment of discussions  
- Sharing sensitive information without consent  

---

## 📑 Community Expectations

Kansas-Frontier-Matrix builds on both **Contributor Covenant** and **MCP principles**:

- **Reproducibility first** → every dataset, experiment, or workflow must be documented & reproducible  
- **Documentation-driven development** → README files, SOPs, schemas as living lab notebooks  
- **Provenance matters** → checksums, STAC metadata, logs ensure traceability  
- **Transparency** → roadmap, governance, design discussions happen in issues/PRs  
- **Respect for history & culture** → Indigenous perspectives, oral traditions, archival integrity  
- **Collaboration over competition** → contributors, reviewers, maintainers work as peers

⸻

🛡️ Enforcement Responsibilities
	•	Maintainers clarify & enforce standards
	•	They may remove, edit, or reject contributions violating this code
	•	Actions may include warnings, temporary restrictions, or removal from the project

⸻

📬 Reporting
	•	Preferred: 📧 security@kansasfrontier.org
	•	Alternative: DM a project maintainer privately
	•	Reports are handled confidentially; reporter identities are protected

⸻

⚖️ Consequences

Depending on severity, maintainers may:

Action	Example Use Case
🟢 Warning	Minor discourtesy, first-time issue
🟡 Corrective action	Require apology or documentation update
🟠 Temporary restriction	Repeated disruptive or exclusionary acts
🔴 Removal / ban	Harassment, threats, severe violations


⸻

🧭 Maintainer Guidelines

Maintainers are expected to model MCP values:
	•	Documentation-first → all features/workflows must include README/schema
	•	Reproducibility → changes regenerable via make targets, avoid one-offs
	•	Provenance → new data requires checksums, STAC, metadata sidecars
	•	CI hygiene → workflows pinned & least-privilege, outputs validated
	•	Transparency → design/governance decisions logged in issues/PRs
	•	Mentorship → guide contributors in schemas, provenance, docs
	•	Consistency → enforce branch protection, rigorous reviews, coding standards

⸻

⚙️ How This Links to CI

Contributor behavior & MCP alignment directly affect automation:
	•	Respectful, well-documented contributions → faster reviews & merges
	•	Reproducibility & provenance → fewer CI failures (stac-validate, schema checks, hashes)
	•	CI hygiene → automerge eligibility once all required checks pass
	•	Transparency in PRs → better roadmap syncing & milestone tracking

👉 Good conduct = smoother pipelines = faster integration.

🌍 Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant v2.1.
