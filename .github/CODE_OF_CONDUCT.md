## 🤝 Our Standards

- Be respectful and inclusive — no harassment or discrimination  
- Assume good intent; provide constructive feedback  
- Accept critique gracefully; disagree without hostility  
- Collaborate openly and transparently  
- Recognize contributions from all community members  

---

## 🚫 Unacceptable Behavior

- Harassment, insults, or derogatory comments  
- Discriminatory language or exclusionary behavior  
- Public or private intimidation, stalking, or threats  
- Disruptive trolling or deliberate derailment of discussions  
- Sharing sensitive information without consent  

---

## 📑 Community Expectations

Kansas-Frontier-Matrix builds on both **Contributor Covenant** and **MCP principles**:

- **Reproducibility first** → every dataset, experiment, or workflow must be documented & reproducible  
- **Documentation-driven development** → README files, SOPs, schemas as living lab notebooks  
- **Provenance matters** → checksums, STAC metadata, logs ensure traceability  
- **Transparency** → roadmap, governance, design discussions happen in issues/PRs  
- **Respect for history & culture** → Indigenous perspectives, oral traditions, archival integrity  
- **Collaboration over competition** → contributors, reviewers, maintainers work as peers

## 🛡️ Enforcement Responsibilities

* Maintainers clarify & enforce standards
* They may remove, edit, or reject contributions violating this code
* Actions may include warnings, temporary restrictions, or removal from the project

---

## 📬 Reporting

* Preferred: 📧 `security@kansasfrontier.org`
* Alternative: DM a project maintainer privately
* Reports are handled confidentially; reporter identities are protected

---

## ⚖️ Consequences

|                       Action | Example Use Case                         |
| ---------------------------: | ---------------------------------------- |
|               🟢 **Warning** | Minor discourtesy, first-time issue      |
|     🟡 **Corrective action** | Require apology or documentation update  |
| 🟠 **Temporary restriction** | Repeated disruptive or exclusionary acts |
|         🔴 **Removal / ban** | Harassment, threats, severe violations   |

## 🧭 Maintainer Guidelines

Maintainers are expected to model MCP values:

* **Documentation-first** → all features/workflows must include README/schema
* **Reproducibility** → changes regenerable via `make` targets, avoid one-offs
* **Provenance** → new data requires checksums, STAC, metadata sidecars
* **CI hygiene** → workflows pinned & least-privilege, outputs validated
* **Transparency** → design/governance decisions logged in issues/PRs
* **Mentorship** → guide contributors in schemas, provenance, docs
* **Consistency** → enforce branch protection, rigorous reviews, coding standards

---

## ⚙️ How This Links to CI

Contributor behavior & MCP alignment directly affect automation:

* Respectful, well-documented contributions → faster reviews & merges
* Reproducibility & provenance → fewer CI failures (stac-validate, schema checks, hashes)
* CI hygiene → automerge eligibility once all required checks pass
* Transparency in PRs → better roadmap syncing & milestone tracking

👉 **Good conduct = smoother pipelines = faster integration.**

---

## 🌍 Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the **Contributor Covenant v2.1**.

---

## ✅ Summary

Kansas-Frontier-Matrix is committed to a safe, respectful, reproducible, and inclusive environment.
Contributors and maintainers alike share responsibility for upholding these values and practicing MCP principles.
