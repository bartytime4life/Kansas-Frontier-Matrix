Maintainers will:

1. Acknowledge receipt of the report (when possible)

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community maintainers will use the following guidelines to determine consequences for actions that violate this Code of Conduct:

| Level | Label | Community impact (examples) | Typical consequence |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Correction** | Unprofessional or unwelcome behavior; minor boundary violations | Private written notice; clarify expectations; may request apology |
| 2 | **Warning** | Clear violation through a single incident or repeated minor incidents | Formal warning; restrictions on interaction may be required |
| 3 | **Temporary ban** | Serious violation; sustained inappropriate behavior | Temporary ban from project spaces; conditions for return may be set |
| 4 | **Permanent ban** | Pattern of violations; harassment; credible safety threats | Permanent removal from project spaces; access revoked where applicable |

### Factors considered

- Impact on harmed person(s) and the community
- Pattern of behavior and prior warnings
- Whether behavior was targeted, discriminatory, or retaliatory
- Whether there is a credible safety concern
- Willingness to repair harm and comply going forward
