# README — DCAT Catalog Fixtures (GitHub Actions)

## 📘 Overview

### Purpose
- This README defines what belongs in `.github/actions/fixtures/catalogs/dcat/` and how DCAT fixtures should be structured, maintained, and validated.
- It governs the expectations for **deterministic, small, public-safe** DCAT examples used by GitHub Actions and local validation/tests.

### Scope

| In Scope | Out of Scope |
|---|---|
| Small DCAT fixture files (typically JSON-LD) intended for CI/tests/examples | Production or canonical catalog outputs |
| Naming/layout conventions for fixture artifacts | Full DCAT / JSON-LD education or profile specification text |
| Validation expectations for fixtures (schema + link integrity + safety) | ETL implementation details and dataset-specific transformation rules |

### Audience
- Primary: CI/workflow maintainers, catalog/profile maintainers.
- Secondary: contributors adding/updating catalog fixtures; reviewers verifying schema compliance.

### Definitions (link to glossary)
- Link: `docs/glossary.md`
- Terms used in this doc:
  - **Fixture**: a small, versioned example artifact used in tests/validation.
  - **DCAT**: W3C Data Catalog Vocabulary representation for dataset metadata.
  - **JSON-LD**: JSON serialization for Linked Data (common for DCAT exports).
  - **Catalog / Dataset / Distribution**: common DCAT concepts (see profile + glossary).

### Key artifacts (what this doc points to)

## 🧭 Context

### Background
- KFM treats **catalog artifacts** (STAC/DCAT/PROV) as first-class evidence products in the pipeline.
- Fixtures exist to let CI/tests validate:
  - JSON-LD well-formedness
  - schema/profile compliance
  - stable identifiers (no run-time timestamps unless explicitly intended)
  - safe/public-friendly examples

### Assumptions
- Fixtures are small enough to review quickly in PRs.
- Fixtures avoid embedding secrets, credentials, or personal data.
- Fixture semantics reflect the current KFM-DCAT profile version listed in front-matter.

### Constraints / invariants
- ETL → STAC/DCAT/PROV → Graph → APIs → UI → Story Nodes → Focus Mode is preserved.
- Frontend consumes contracts via APIs (no direct graph dependency).
- Fixture catalogs must remain **test artifacts**; they must not become a “shadow copy” of production outputs.

### Open questions

| Question | Owner | Target date |
|---|---|---|
| Do we standardize fixture naming (e.g., `minimal_*`, `edge_*`) across STAC/DCAT/PROV? | CI + Catalog owners | TBD |
| Do we require JSON-LD compaction/canonicalization in CI to reduce diff noise? | Contracts owners | TBD |
| Do we introduce SHACL validation for DCAT JSON-LD fixtures? | Catalog owners | TBD |

### Future extensions
- Add fixtures for:
  - minimum-valid DCAT catalog
  - multi-distribution dataset
  - redaction edge-cases (generalized geometry, obscured locations)
  - controlled vocab alignment tests

## 📦 Data & Metadata

### Inputs
- DCAT fixture files stored in this directory.
- Related profile/spec documents (e.g., `docs/standards/KFM_DCAT_PROFILE.md`) used by validators.

### Outputs
- CI validation results (pass/fail) and diagnostic logs.
- (Optional) formatted validation reports, if the workflow/action supports them.

### Sensitivity & redaction
- Fixtures in this directory are **public/open** by default.
- Do not include:
  - secrets, tokens, keys
  - private emails/phone numbers
  - sensitive site locations (unless generalized and explicitly marked as redacted examples)
- If a fixture demonstrates redaction logic, the file must clearly label the redaction intent.

### Quality signals
- Schema/profile validation passes.
- Fixtures are deterministic (stable identifiers; no nondeterministic ordering where avoidable).
- Links/identifiers are consistent with the profile’s expectations (even if URLs are non-resolving in offline CI).

## 🌐 STAC, DCAT & PROV Alignment

### STAC
- Not covered here. If STAC fixtures are used, keep them in a sibling directory (e.g., `.../catalogs/stac/`) and document separately.

### DCAT
- Fixtures here should align to the KFM DCAT profile:
  - required fields present
  - stable identifiers
  - classifications and licenses are explicit

### PROV-O
- If a DCAT fixture references provenance (e.g., a run/activity), ensure it aligns with KFM-PROV expectations and does not embed sensitive data.

### Versioning
- Treat fixture updates like contract updates:
  - keep IDs stable unless intentionally testing “ID migration”
  - record changes in the Version History section below
  - update tests/validators if fixtures change shape

## 🧱 Architecture

### Components
- Fixture artifacts: JSON-LD DCAT examples in this directory
- Validators: schema/profile checks in CI (workflow/action dependent)
- Contracts: `schemas/` + `docs/standards/` defining what “valid” means

### Interfaces / contracts
- Fixture artifacts must validate against the schema/profile contracts the repo defines (schemas + standards).
- This directory must not introduce new “ad-hoc” meanings that conflict with KFM-DCAT.

### Extension points checklist (for future work)
- [ ] Add a new fixture category (minimal/edge/redaction)
- [ ] Add/update validation scripts/workflows to include the fixture
- [ ] Add a short rationale comment at top of each new fixture file (what it tests)
- [ ] Ensure any example identifiers follow stable ID rules

## 🧠 Story Node & Focus Mode Integration

### How this work surfaces in Focus Mode
- These fixtures do not directly surface in Focus Mode.
- If a fixture is used for demos or documentation examples that feed Story Nodes, the same governance rules apply (provenance-linked claims; redaction compliance).

### Provenance-linked narrative rule
- Every claim must trace to a dataset / record / asset ID.

### Optional structured controls
~~~yaml
# Optional example only — not required for catalog fixtures.
focus_layers: []
focus_time: null
focus_center: [ -98.0000, 38.0000 ]
~~~

## 🧪 Validation & CI/CD

### Validation steps
- [ ] Markdown protocol checks (this README)
- [ ] JSON-LD syntax checks for fixture files
- [ ] Schema/profile validation for DCAT fixtures
- [ ] Link/identifier sanity checks (as supported by validators)
- [ ] Security and sovereignty checks (as applicable)

### Reproduction
~~~bash
# Example placeholders — replace with repo-specific commands

# 1) run catalog/contract validators (DCAT)
# <command>

# 2) run unit/integration tests that reference fixtures
# <command>

# 3) run doc lint / markdown checks
# <command>
~~~

### Telemetry signals (if applicable)

| Signal | Source | Where recorded |
|---|---|---|
| Fixture validation pass/fail | CI workflow logs | GitHub Actions logs (and/or `docs/telemetry/` if exported) |

## ⚖ FAIR+CARE & Governance

### Review gates
- Changes to fixtures should be reviewed by:
  - CI/workflow owners (to ensure tests remain meaningful)
  - catalog/profile owners (to ensure fixtures remain compliant)

### CARE / sovereignty considerations
- If fixtures represent culturally sensitive information or protected locations, ensure:
  - redaction/generalization is applied
  - the fixture is explicitly labeled as a redaction example
  - the sovereignty policy and ethics policy are followed

### AI usage constraints
- Ensure this doc’s AI permissions/prohibitions match intended use.
- Do not use AI to infer or reconstruct sensitive locations from redacted examples.
