# ‚öôÔ∏è Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **GitHub Actions Workflows**
`.github/workflows/README.md`

**Purpose:** Describes all Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) workflows that automate builds, validations, and ethical AI governance for the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
Implements full-stack reproducibility and compliance checks under the **Master Coder Protocol (MCP-DL v6.3)**.

> **In summary:**  
> The `.github/workflows/` directory houses all **CI/CD pipelines** that ensure data, code, and documentation are reproducible, validated, secure, and ethically governed.

---

## üìö Overview

These workflows coordinate every automation process in the Kansas Frontier Matrix monorepo.  
Each pipeline performs a modular role, together forming an auditable system that validates:
- Build and deployment consistency  
- Geospatial metadata integrity  
- FAIR+CARE ethical compliance  
- AI/ML reproducibility and model drift prevention  
- System and dependency security  

All actions are executed through GitHub Actions and produce logs under the `/reports/` directory for MCP verification.

| `codeql.yml` | Performs static code analysis for vulnerabilities using GitHub CodeQL. | Push / Weekly schedule | `reports/security/codeql_analysis.json` |
| `trivy.yml` | Scans containers and dependencies for CVEs and generates SBOM reports. | Push / Weekly schedule | `reports/security/trivy_scan_results.json` |
| `pre-commit.yml` | Runs pre-commit formatting, linting, and documentation checks. | Push / Pull Request | `reports/lint/precommit_validation.log` |
| `faircare-validate.yml` | Enforces FAIR+CARE validation for new data and governance updates. | Push / PR / Manual trigger | `reports/fair/` & `reports/audit/` |
| `governance-ledger.yml` | Updates provenance ledger, hash integrity, and governance audit files. | On merge to `main` | `reports/audit/ai_hazards_ledger.json` |

## üß† Workflow Relationships

```mermaid

A[Commit / PR / Scheduled Task] --> B[Pre-Commit Validation]
B --> C[Build & Site Deploy (site.yml)]
B --> D[STAC Validation (stac-validate.yml)]
C --> E[FAIR+CARE Audit (faircare-validate.yml)]
D --> F[Governance Ledger (governance-ledger.yml)]
E --> G[Security Scans (codeql.yml / trivy.yml)]
F --> H[Artifact + Telemetry Upload]
H --> I[Focus Mode Dashboard + Governance Ledger]
```

Each workflow feeds its results into the **FAIR+CARE governance pipeline**, linking artifacts to the Focus Mode telemetry system for traceability and auditability.

---

## üß© Workflow Descriptions

### üß± `site.yml` ‚Äî Build & Deployment
Builds and deploys the MapLibre-based web app and static documentation site.  
Key stages:
- Install Node.js & Python dependencies  
- Run frontend build (`npm run build`)  
- Deploy with `gh-pages`  
- Log artifacts and provenance to `/releases/v9.3.2/`

---

### üß™ `stac-validate.yml` ‚Äî STAC Catalog Compliance
Validates all datasets in `data/stac/` for:
- Proper temporal, spatial, and license metadata  
- Linkage to source manifests (`data/sources/`)  
- Compliance with STAC 1.0 and DCAT 3.0 standards  

Outputs validation reports to `reports/self-validation/`.

---

### üîç `codeql.yml` ‚Äî Static Code Security
Runs GitHub CodeQL to ensure code security across:
- Python backend (ETL, AI/ML)  
- React frontend (web/src)  
- YAML, shell, and build scripts  

Reports are exported to `reports/security/codeql_analysis.json`.

---

### üß∞ `trivy.yml` ‚Äî Container & Dependency Vulnerability Scans
Performs security scans and generates SBOM artifacts (`.spdx.json`):
- Analyzes Docker images and dependencies  
- Checks Node and Python package CVEs  
- Records results to `reports/security/trivy_scan_results.json`

---

### üß© `pre-commit.yml` ‚Äî Documentation & Style Checks
Runs all pre-commit hooks:
- Enforces **KFM Markdown Rules** (MCP-DL syntax)  
- Lints Python, JavaScript, and YAML  
- Validates docs metadata (frontmatter & badges)

---

### üß≠ `faircare-validate.yml` ‚Äî FAIR+CARE Data Governance
Validates FAIR+CARE compliance for each dataset, manifest, and document:
- Verifies completeness of metadata fields  
- Ensures ethical use, consent, and attribution  
- Updates `reports/fair/hazards_summary.json` and `reports/audit/ai_hazards_ledger.json`

---

### üßæ `governance-ledger.yml` ‚Äî Provenance & Ledger Updates
Final step in CI/CD chain ‚Äî generates immutable audit trails:
- Calculates SHA-256 checksums for data & AI outputs  
- Appends governance records to `reports/audit/`  
- Publishes results to `releases/v9.3.2/focus-telemetry.json`

---

## üîç Trigger Types

| Trigger | Purpose |
|----------|----------|
| **Push** | Executes validation and build jobs on code or dataset changes. |
| **Pull Request** | Runs MCP-DL validation to gate merges. |
| **Schedule (cron)** | Weekly audits and security scanning. |
| **Workflow Dispatch** | Manual FAIR+CARE or governance verification. |

---

## üß≠ Governance Integration

Every workflow feeds into the **Governance Ledger**, updating:
- `reports/audit/` ‚Äî Provenance & ethical AI trace logs  
- `reports/fair/` ‚Äî FAIR+CARE metrics  
- `releases/` ‚Äî Telemetry & SBOM snapshots  
- `data/stac/` ‚Äî Metadata sync and lineage validation  

Workflows cross-reference:
- `docs/standards/governance/`  
- `data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/system/`  
- `reports/audit/ai_hazards_ledger.json`

---

## üß© FAIR+CARE Compliance

FAIR Principles:
- **Findable:** All workflows register results in STAC and FAIR metadata.  
- **Accessible:** All logs and SBOMs are stored in open, reusable formats.  
- **Interoperable:** Workflows follow GitHub Actions + MCP-DL conventions.  
- **Reusable:** Each job logs build environments and dependency states.  

CARE Principles:
- **Collective Benefit:** Ensures equitable access to open-source science.  
- **Authority to Control:** FAIR+CARE Council reviews automated decisions.  
- **Responsibility:** Ethics validation pipelines prevent misuse.  
- **Ethics:** Ledger verification guarantees transparency for every action.
