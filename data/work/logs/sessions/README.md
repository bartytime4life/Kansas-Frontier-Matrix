# üßë‚Äçüíª Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Session Logs**
`data/work/logs/sessions/README.md`

**Purpose:** Tracks interactive sessions, Focus Mode events, and real-time user interactions executed within Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
Session logs ensure reproducibility of user actions, contextual queries, and AI-assisted insights under FAIR+CARE governance and audit control.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/logs/sessions/` directory records all **interactive and AI-assisted session logs**, including:
- User interactions within Focus Mode and Exploration Mode.  
- AI-generated responses and contextual summaries.  
- Session telemetry and governance context for audit tracking.  
- FAIR+CARE user accountability and transparency metadata.  

Each session log represents a discrete time-bounded record that links human actions, AI insights, and resulting outputs for full reproducibility and ethical review.

```

### Description:
1. **Capture:** Session begins upon user entry into Focus Mode or KFM web interface.  
2. **Telemetry:** Real-time user and AI actions captured with timestamps and context.  
3. **Ethics Review:** FAIR+CARE filters verify privacy and compliance boundaries.  
4. **Governance:** Session metadata and hashes logged to `data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json`.

## üß† FAIR+CARE Governance in Session Logging

| Principle | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Findable** | Each session log contains unique session ID, timestamps, and context tags. |
| **Accessible** | Logs available to FAIR+CARE governance reviewers (non-public). |
| **Interoperable** | Logs stored as JSON and plain text for universal parsing. |
| **Reusable** | Metadata ensures reproducibility of AI-assisted workflows. |
| **Collective Benefit** | Improves transparency of human‚ÄìAI interaction processes. |
| **Authority to Control** | FAIR+CARE Council oversees retention and access controls. |
| **Responsibility** | Logs reviewed for ethical compliance and reproducibility. |
| **Ethics** | Contains no personal data; anonymized for governance integrity. |

Governance audits reference:  
`data/reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json` and `data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Session Telemetry Schema

| Field | Description | Example |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| `timestamp` | Time of logged interaction | `2025-10-28T15:33:22Z` |
| `action_type` | User or AI event type | `user_query`, `ai_response`, `map_interaction` |
| `content` | Text or context payload of event | `"Show me tornado paths for 1999"` |
| `latency_ms` | Processing duration | `843` |
| `source_component` | System module that generated the log | `FocusMode-UI`, `AI-Engine` |
| `result_checksum` | Hash of AI output or response | `sha256:...` |

All session telemetry validated for schema conformance under `data/reports/validation/schema_validation_summary.json`.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Governance & Provenance Integration

| Record | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `metadata.json` | Session-level runtime, duration, and provenance metadata. |
| `data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json` | Logs session hashes and FAIR+CARE status. |
| `data/reports/validation/schema_validation_summary.json` | Schema compliance verification for session telemetry. |
| `releases/v9.3.2/manifest.zip` | Contains global checksum references for all sessions. |

---

## üßæ Session Retention Policy

| Log Type | Retention | Policy |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| Session Telemetry | 30 days | Purged after review or upon user request. |
| Query Traces | 14 days | Retained for performance audit only. |
| AI Context Snapshots | 7 days | Automatically regenerated each model version. |
| Governance Metadata | 365 days | Permanent archival in audit ledger. |

Retention automation handled via `session_logs_cleanup.yml` GitHub Action.
