# ‚öôÔ∏è Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **ETL Logs**
`data/work/logs/etl/README.md`

**Purpose:** Captures structured logs, transformation reports, and validation summaries from all ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines within the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
These logs provide reproducibility, transparency, and FAIR+CARE-compliant accountability for every data processing operation.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/logs/etl/` directory contains runtime logs and transformation records generated by KFM‚Äôs **ETL pipelines**.  
Each log provides step-by-step documentation of data ingestion, normalization, validation, and export operations ‚Äî ensuring full lineage visibility and governance compliance.

### ETL Logging Objectives:
- Record every data transformation stage for reproducibility.  
- Log validation errors, schema mismatches, and correction details.  
- Capture FAIR+CARE metadata propagation across pipeline steps.  
- Synchronize with governance ledger and checksum manifest after each run.

All ETL logs are machine-readable, JSON-structured, and integrated into the KFM audit system.

## ‚öôÔ∏è ETL Logging Workflow

    A["Raw Data Ingestion (data/raw/*)"] --> B["Transformation Pipeline Execution (src/pipelines/etl/*)"]
    B --> C["Schema and FAIR+CARE Validation"]
    C --> D["Write Logs to data/work/logs/etl/"]
    D --> E["Governance Ledger Sync and Manifest Update"]
```

### Process Steps:
1. **Ingestion:** Raw data fetched from external sources (NOAA, USGS, FEMA, etc.).  
2. **Transformation:** Normalization, spatial harmonization, and metadata enrichment.  
3. **Validation:** Schema, checksum, and FAIR+CARE ethical compliance checks.  
4. **Logging:** Outputs written to structured logs for provenance auditing.  
5. **Governance:** Log summaries linked to `data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json`.

## üß† FAIR+CARE Governance in ETL

| Principle | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Findable** | Each ETL run uniquely identified and logged with dataset references. |
| **Accessible** | Logs available to internal governance council and automation workflows. |
| **Interoperable** | JSON and CSV log formats ensure broad compatibility. |
| **Reusable** | Logs retain provenance and schema tracebacks for reproducibility. |
| **Collective Benefit** | Enables ethical, transparent scientific workflows. |
| **Authority to Control** | Maintainers can trace, review, and verify each ETL operation. |
| **Responsibility** | Validation results recorded for FAIR+CARE compliance. |
| **Ethics** | Logs contain no sensitive data ‚Äî technical metadata only. |

Governance audits reference:  
`data/reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json` and `data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Log Types

| Log File | Description | Format |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| `etl_run_*.log` | Execution trace for ETL sessions (success/failure, duration, errors). | Plain text |
| `etl_validation_summary.json` | Schema and FAIR+CARE validation outcomes. | JSON |
| `etl_performance_metrics.json` | Throughput, memory, and runtime metrics for performance analysis. | JSON |
| `transformation_steps.log` | Stepwise normalization and data cleaning operations. | Plain text |
| `metadata.json` | Provenance metadata linking ETL logs to governance ledger. | JSON |

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Governance & Provenance Integration

| Record | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `metadata.json` | Records pipeline name, checksum, and runtime context. |
| `data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json` | Master record for ETL lineage and checksum validation. |
| `data/reports/validation/stac_validation_report.json` | Validation and schema review report. |
| `releases/v9.3.2/manifest.zip` | Global checksum registry for reproducible ETL artifacts. |

---

## üßæ ETL Log Retention Policy

| Log Type | Retention Duration | Policy |
|-----------|--------------------|--------|
| ETL Execution Logs | 90 days | Archived quarterly to `data/archive/logs/etl/`. |
| Validation Reports | 180 days | Retained permanently for FAIR+CARE review. |
| Performance Metrics | 60 days | Purged after governance audit verification. |
| Transformation Logs | 30 days | Cleared upon next successful ETL run. |

Retention automated by `etl_logs_cleanup.yml` GitHub Action.
