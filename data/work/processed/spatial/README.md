# üó∫Ô∏è Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Processed Spatial Data**
`data/work/processed/spatial/README.md`

**Purpose:** Final FAIR+CARE-certified repository for spatial datasets produced by the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
Contains harmonized, validated, and provenance-tracked spatial products ready for public access, scientific visualization, and catalog publication.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/processed/spatial/` directory hosts **final spatial datasets** that have been validated, ethics-audited, and governance-certified under the FAIR+CARE framework.  
Each dataset is interoperable, catalog-linked, and schema-aligned with STAC 1.0, DCAT 3.0, and GeoJSON/GeoParquet standards for open geospatial data dissemination.

### Core Responsibilities:
- Store authoritative geospatial datasets including DEMs, boundaries, and thematic layers.  
- Guarantee spatial integrity, coordinate system normalization (EPSG:4326), and provenance.  
- Integrate with KFM‚Äôs STAC/DCAT catalog for public data discovery.  
- Ensure all spatial layers are ethically validated under FAIR+CARE governance.  

All data in this layer are open-access, CC-BY 4.0 licensed, and version-controlled.

    C --> D["Checksum Verification and Governance Certification"]
    D --> E["Export Final Spatial Data (data/work/processed/spatial/)"]
    E --> F["STAC/DCAT Catalog Synchronization"]
```

### Workflow Description:
1. **Harmonization:** Integrate and standardize spatial datasets from staging, ensuring CRS normalization to EPSG:4326.  
2. **Validation:** Run FAIR+CARE spatial audits, geometry QA, and schema verification.  
3. **Certification:** Record provenance, lineage, and checksum for transparency.  
4. **Publication:** Export final datasets with standardized metadata and governance approval.  
5. **Catalog Integration:** Register spatial products in STAC/DCAT metadata catalogs for discoverability.

## üß† FAIR+CARE Compliance Overview

| Principle | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Findable** | Indexed through KFM STAC/DCAT catalogs and searchable via spatial IDs. |
| **Accessible** | Published in open GeoJSON, GeoTIFF, and Parquet formats. |
| **Interoperable** | CRS normalized (EPSG:4326) and aligned with STAC 1.0/GeoSPARQL. |
| **Reusable** | Metadata includes full provenance and ethical audit trails. |
| **Collective Benefit** | Facilitates open, reproducible geospatial research for Kansas. |
| **Authority to Control** | FAIR+CARE Council oversees release and ethics validation. |
| **Responsibility** | Validators maintain QA, schema, and governance trace logs. |
| **Ethics** | Data cleared of sensitive information or restricted-use geographies. |

All ethics and FAIR+CARE results recorded in:  
`data/reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json` and  
`data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json`.
