# 📊 Kansas Frontier Matrix — **Processed Tabular Data**
`data/work/processed/tabular/README.md`

**Purpose:** Canonical repository of FAIR+CARE-certified tabular datasets generated by the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
This layer hosts finalized, schema-aligned, and governance-certified tabular products ready for publication, distribution, and advanced analytics.

## 📚 Overview

The `data/work/processed/tabular/` directory contains **finalized tabular datasets** that have completed ETL transformation, schema validation, FAIR+CARE audits, and provenance certification.  
These datasets form the structured backbone for analytics, reporting, AI feature stores, and catalog indexing within KFM’s open-data ecosystem.

### Core Responsibilities
- Maintain validated tabular datasets under open FAIR+CARE governance.  
- Guarantee schema integrity, version traceability, and checksum verification.  
- Provide model-ready, human-readable, and machine-interoperable data.  
- Preserve lineage across staging, validation, and processed workflows.  

All tabular data here are open-access under **CC-BY 4.0** and registered in the **KFM Governance Ledger**.

│
├── environmental_indicators.csv           # Aggregated environmental & climate indicators for Kansas

## ⚙️ Processing Workflow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Staged Tabular Data (data/work/staging/tabular/)"] --> B["Schema Normalization & Aggregation"]
    B --> C["FAIR+CARE Certification (Ethics & Governance)"]
    C --> D["Checksum & Provenance Registration"]
    D --> E["Publish to Processed Layer (data/work/processed/tabular/)"]
    E --> F["Catalog Registration (STAC/DCAT) & Governance Sync"]
```

### Workflow Steps
1. **Normalization:** Apply standardized schemas, field naming, data types, and controlled vocabularies.  
2. **Aggregation:** Merge validated staging tables and compute derived indicators and rollups.  
3. **Audit:** Run FAIR+CARE validation and ethics checks with documented outcomes.  
4. **Certification:** Register lineage and checksums in the provenance ledger; finalize license and version.  
5. **Publication:** Export datasets in CSV and Parquet; synchronize with STAC/DCAT catalogs.

## 🧠 FAIR+CARE Governance Summary

| Principle | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Findable** | Catalog-indexed with dataset ID, schema version, and rich metadata. |
| **Accessible** | Open-access CSV and Parquet with public documentation. |
| **Interoperable** | JSON Schema + DCAT alignment; consistent data types and vocabularies. |
| **Reusable** | Provenance, versioning, and checksums support reproducibility. |
| **Collective Benefit** | Enables equitable data access and open research collaboration. |
| **Authority to Control** | FAIR+CARE Council validates final certifications. |
| **Responsibility** | Validators maintain audit logs, schema diffs, and outcomes. |
| **Ethics** | Reviewed to ensure neutrality, privacy, and accessibility compliance. |

Certification records are archived in:  
`data/reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json` and `data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json`.

## ⚙️ Validation & QA Reports

| Report | Description | Output |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `schema_validation_summary.json` | Final schema conformity and type validation report. | JSON |
| `faircare_certification_report.json` | FAIR+CARE audit outcomes and ethics review. | JSON |
| `checksums.json` | File integrity and provenance SHA-256 registry. | JSON |
| `catalog_sync.log` | STAC/DCAT catalog registration and sync log. | Text |

All validation and publishing tasks are automated by `.github/workflows/processed_tabular_sync.yml`.

---

## ⚖️ Governance & Provenance Integration

| Record | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `metadata.json` | Captures schema version, checksum, and FAIR+CARE certification details. |
| `data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json` | Logs lineage, ethics certification, and dataset traceability. |
| `data/reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json` | FAIR+CARE compliance and ethics tracking record. |
| `releases/v9.4.0/manifest.zip` | Global checksum registry for processed tabular datasets. |

Governance synchronization runs automatically post-certification cycle.

---

## 🧾 Retention & Publication Policy

| Data Category | Retention | Policy |
|----------------|------------|--------|
| Processed Tabular Data | Permanent | Retained as canonical open datasets (CC-BY 4.0). |
| Validation Reports | 365 days | Archived for re-audit and reproducibility. |
| Governance Metadata | Permanent | Stored for long-term lineage and citation integrity. |
| Catalog Logs | 90 days | Archived after successful publication. |
