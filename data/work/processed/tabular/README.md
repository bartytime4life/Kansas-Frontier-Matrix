# üìä Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Processed Tabular Data**
`data/work/processed/tabular/README.md`

**Purpose:** Canonical repository of FAIR+CARE-certified tabular datasets generated by the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
This layer hosts final, schema-aligned, and governance-certified tabular data products ready for publication, distribution, and analytical use.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/processed/tabular/` directory contains **finalized tabular datasets** that have completed ETL transformation, schema validation, FAIR+CARE audits, and provenance certification.  
These datasets form the structured foundation for analytics, reporting, and catalog indexing within KFM‚Äôs open-data ecosystem.

### Core Responsibilities:
- Maintain validated tabular datasets under open FAIR+CARE governance.  
- Guarantee schema integrity and version traceability for every dataset.  
- Provide model-ready, human-readable, and machine-interoperable data.  
- Preserve data lineage across staging, validation, and processed workflows.  

All tabular data here are open-access under CC-BY 4.0 and registered in KFM‚Äôs governance ledger.

    C --> D["Checksum and Provenance Validation"]
    D --> E["Export to Processed Layer (data/work/processed/tabular/)"]
    E --> F["Catalog Registration and Governance Synchronization"]
```

### Workflow Steps:
1. **Normalization:** Apply consistent schema definitions and field naming standards.  
2. **Aggregation:** Merge validated staging tables and compute summary indicators.  
3. **Audit:** Run FAIR+CARE validation and ethics checks.  
4. **Certification:** Register lineage and checksums in governance ledger.  
5. **Publication:** Export datasets as CSV or Parquet for analytics and catalog use.

## üß† FAIR+CARE Governance Summary

| Principle | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Findable** | Indexed in catalog with dataset ID, metadata, and schema version. |
| **Accessible** | Open-access CSV and Parquet formats under CC-BY 4.0. |
| **Interoperable** | Schema and metadata aligned with JSON Schema and DCAT. |
| **Reusable** | Provenance metadata and checksums ensure reproducibility. |
| **Collective Benefit** | Promotes equitable data access and open research collaboration. |
| **Authority to Control** | FAIR+CARE Council validates final dataset certifications. |
| **Responsibility** | Validators document audit logs and FAIR+CARE outcomes. |
| **Ethics** | Datasets reviewed to ensure neutrality and data privacy compliance. |

Certification records are archived within:  
`data/reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json`  
and `data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json`.
