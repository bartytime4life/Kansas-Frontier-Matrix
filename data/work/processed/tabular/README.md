# 📊 Kansas Frontier Matrix — **Processed Tabular Data**
`data/work/processed/tabular/README.md`

**Purpose:**  
Canonical repository of **FAIR+CARE-certified tabular datasets** generated by Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM) pipelines.  
These datasets represent the final, schema-aligned, validated, and governance-certified tabular outputs used for open research, AI analytics, and Focus Mode data visualization.

## 📚 Overview

The **Processed Tabular Layer** hosts final structured data tables verified under FAIR+CARE governance.  
All datasets here are **ethically certified**, **checksum-verified**, and **schema-compliant** — suitable for reuse, analysis, and publication under open-access data standards.

### Core Objectives
- Publish validated tabular datasets with FAIR+CARE and DCAT interoperability.  
- Maintain schema-aligned and checksum-audited tabular data.  
- Register provenance lineage and governance approvals for reproducibility.  
- Enable integration with AI models and public dashboards.

## ⚙️ Tabular Data Processing Workflow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Validated Tabular Data (data/work/staging/tabular/)"] --> B["Schema Harmonization & Normalization"]
    B --> C["FAIR+CARE Ethics & Accessibility Certification"]
    C --> D["Checksum Verification & Provenance Logging"]
    D --> E["Catalog Synchronization (DCAT 3.0)"]
    E --> F["Final Publication (data/work/processed/tabular/)"]
```

### Workflow Summary
1. **Normalization:** Aligns fields with DCAT 3.0 and JSON Schema definitions.  
2. **Certification:** FAIR+CARE Council validates ethical compliance and reuse readiness.  
3. **Verification:** Cross-checks integrity using manifest-linked checksums.  
4. **Publication:** Certified tables exported to open-access processed layer.  
5. **Synchronization:** Registered in STAC/DCAT catalogs and governance ledgers.
