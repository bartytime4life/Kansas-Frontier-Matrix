# üíß Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Processed Hydrology Data**
`data/work/processed/hydrology/README.md`

**Purpose:** Repository for FAIR+CARE-certified hydrological datasets including streamflow, aquifer, and watershed data processed within the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
This layer consolidates validated and schema-aligned hydrologic information from USGS, NOAA, EPA, and state agencies for open access and scientific reproducibility.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/processed/hydrology/` directory contains **final hydrological datasets** produced through KFM‚Äôs governance-certified ETL and validation pipelines.  
These datasets are harmonized across multiple agencies, schema-aligned with FAIR+CARE standards, and ready for distribution or modeling.

### Core Responsibilities:
- Maintain processed watershed, groundwater, and surface water datasets for Kansas.  
- Provide normalized, ethics-certified data for hydrologic modeling and analysis.  
- Preserve dataset lineage, checksums, and provenance for reproducibility.  
- Integrate hydrologic data with FAIR+CARE metadata frameworks and STAC/DCAT catalogs.  

All data in this workspace are final, validated, and open under CC-BY 4.0 licensing.

    A["Staged Hydrology Data (data/work/staging/hydrology/)"] --> B["Schema Harmonization and Aggregation"]
    B --> C["FAIR and CARE Governance Validation"]
    C --> D["Checksum Verification and Metadata Finalization"]
    D --> E["Publication and Catalog Registration (data/work/processed/hydrology/)"]
```

### Workflow Steps:
1. **Harmonization:** Combine groundwater, streamflow, and watershed datasets from staging.  
2. **Aggregation:** Compute statewide hydrological summaries and long-term trends.  
3. **Validation:** Apply FAIR+CARE audits and schema validation checks.  
4. **Certification:** Register provenance and checksum results to governance ledger.  
5. **Publication:** Export verified datasets in open, interoperable formats.

## üß† FAIR+CARE Compliance Summary

| Principle | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Findable** | Indexed with STAC/DCAT catalog metadata and hydrology schema descriptors. |
| **Accessible** | Distributed in open CSV, GeoJSON, and Parquet formats. |
| **Interoperable** | Schema harmonized across USGS, EPA, and NOAA datasets. |
| **Reusable** | Metadata includes versioning, provenance, and checksum information. |
| **Collective Benefit** | Enables ethical and transparent hydrological research and management. |
| **Authority to Control** | FAIR+CARE Council ensures compliance with water data ethics. |
| **Responsibility** | Data maintainers document all validation and audit results. |
| **Ethics** | Datasets exclude sensitive geospatial information on private wells or restricted basins. |

Certification results stored in:  
`data/reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json`  
and `data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json`.
