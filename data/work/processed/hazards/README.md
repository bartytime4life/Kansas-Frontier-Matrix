# ‚ö†Ô∏è Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Processed Hazards Data**
`data/work/processed/hazards/README.md`

**Purpose:** Final repository for FAIR+CARE-certified multi-hazard datasets within the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
This layer consolidates validated hazard information from FEMA, NOAA, USGS, and NCEI sources, forming the authoritative and ethically governed hazard dataset collection for Kansas.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/processed/hazards/` directory contains **finalized hazard datasets** that have passed KFM‚Äôs FAIR+CARE governance pipeline.  
These datasets represent harmonized, validated, and audit-certified records of hazard events and risk models, ensuring open accessibility and reproducibility for public and research use.

### Core Functions:
- Store authoritative, schema-compliant hazard datasets for Kansas.  
- Maintain provenance records for FEMA, NOAA, USGS, and NCEI hazard integrations.  
- Ensure FAIR+CARE ethical and transparency compliance across all hazard domains.  
- Provide multi-hazard datasets for visualization, modeling, and analytics.  

All datasets here have completed full lineage verification and certification under MCP-DL v6.3 and FAIR+CARE ethics audit procedures.

    C --> D["Checksum Verification & Certification"]
    D --> E["Final Publication (data/work/processed/hazards/)"]
    E --> F["Catalog Synchronization (STAC/DCAT)"]
```

### Workflow Description:
1. **Integration:** Merge validated staging datasets across FEMA, NOAA, and USGS domains.  
2. **Normalization:** Apply consistent schema, coordinate systems, and units of measure.  
3. **Ethics Audit:** Conduct FAIR+CARE certification for open accessibility and transparency.  
4. **Certification:** Register checksums and governance details for each dataset.  
5. **Publication:** Export finalized data into public-ready, CC-BY-licensed formats.

## üß† FAIR+CARE Compliance Summary

| Principle | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Findable** | Indexed via STAC/DCAT catalog with spatial and temporal metadata. |
| **Accessible** | Published in open formats (CSV, GeoJSON) under CC-BY 4.0. |
| **Interoperable** | Schema harmonized across NOAA, FEMA, and USGS hazard data. |
| **Reusable** | Provenance, checksum, and version metadata ensure reproducibility. |
| **Collective Benefit** | Supports open hazard awareness and mitigation planning. |
| **Authority to Control** | FAIR+CARE Council reviews each hazard release for compliance. |
| **Responsibility** | Hazard maintainers document data lineage and ethical review. |
| **Ethics** | Datasets reviewed for accuracy, inclusivity, and non-sensational representation. |

FAIR+CARE governance reports are recorded in:  
`data/reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json`  
and `data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json`.
