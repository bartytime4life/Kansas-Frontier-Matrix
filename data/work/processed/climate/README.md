# üåé Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Processed Climate Data**
`data/work/processed/climate/README.md`

**Purpose:** Repository of final, FAIR+CARE-certified climate datasets derived from NOAA, NIDIS, and related sources.  
These datasets represent harmonized, validated, and governance-registered climate products ready for public access, model integration, and historical analysis within the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/processed/climate/` directory contains **final climate datasets** that have passed all FAIR+CARE governance, schema validation, and checksum verification steps.  
Each dataset in this workspace is considered a canonical data product‚Äîready for catalog publication, analytical modeling, and external data reuse.

### Core Responsibilities:
- Store production-grade climate datasets for distribution and archival.  
- Maintain provenance, lineage, and FAIR+CARE certification metadata.  
- Ensure interoperability with STAC, DCAT, and schema.org catalogs.  
- Provide transparent data access for climate, drought, and temperature analyses.  

All contents are open-access under a CC-BY 4.0 license, fully traceable through KFM‚Äôs provenance and ethics governance system.

    B --> C["FAIR+CARE Certification & Provenance Logging"]
    C --> D["Export Final Processed Products (data/work/processed/climate/)"]
    D --> E["Catalog Synchronization (STAC/DCAT)"]
```

### Workflow Steps:
1. **Harmonization:** Merge and aggregate staging datasets into consistent temporal and spatial structures.  
2. **Validation:** Run schema and FAIR+CARE audits for completeness and integrity.  
3. **Certification:** Assign checksum, ethics score, and governance ledger registration.  
4. **Publication:** Export as open data products under CC-BY 4.0 license.  
5. **Synchronization:** Register datasets in KFM‚Äôs STAC/DCAT catalog for discoverability.

## üß† FAIR+CARE Compliance Summary

| Principle | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Findable** | Indexed with unique dataset IDs and catalog metadata (STAC/DCAT). |
| **Accessible** | Published in open, machine-readable formats (CSV, Parquet). |
| **Interoperable** | Schema compliant with NOAA, USDM, and KFM metadata standards. |
| **Reusable** | Metadata includes provenance, schema, and license information. |
| **Collective Benefit** | Supports open environmental science and public climate literacy. |
| **Authority to Control** | FAIR+CARE Council verifies ethical compliance before publication. |
| **Responsibility** | Validators maintain audit and lineage metadata for all products. |
| **Ethics** | Verified public-domain datasets with equitable, transparent coverage. |

FAIR+CARE certification results recorded in:  
`data/reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json`  
and `data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Validation & QA Reports

| Report | Description | Output |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `schema_validation_summary.json` | Validates final schema conformity and integrity. | JSON |
| `faircare_certification_report.json` | FAIR+CARE ethics certification summary. | JSON |
| `checksums.json` | Records SHA-256 checksums for all processed files. | JSON |
| `catalog_sync.log` | Logs catalog publication events and status. | Text |

Automated QA handled by `processed_climate_sync.yml`.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Governance & Provenance Integration
