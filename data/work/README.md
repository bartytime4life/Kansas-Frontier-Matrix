# ‚öôÔ∏è Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Work Directory (Diamond‚Åµ‚Å∫‚Å∫ Crown‚Å∫‚Å∫ Certified)**  
`data/work/`

**Mission:** Provide a **sandboxed, ephemeral workspace** for intermediate artifacts,  
debug outputs, and AI-audited caches generated during **ETL, STAC validation, ML preprocessing,  
and CI/CD workflows** across the **Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM)**.

## üß≠ System Context

The `data/work/` directory functions as an **AI-governed sandbox** for all temporary, regenerable artifacts.  
It is the **controlled volatility zone** of KFM ‚Äî monitored by Focus Mode AI for reproducibility,  
data drift, fairness, and compliance with the **Master Coder Protocol (MCP-DL v6.3)**.

> *‚ÄúEvery temporary byte teaches the system to regenerate smarter.‚Äù*

## üß† AI Cognitive Feedback Loop

Focus Mode AI continuously:
- Detects checksum drift and validates reproducibility.
- Learns optimization patterns from frequent ETL regenerations.
- Analyzes AI model performance from `cache/` logs.
- Reports results in:
  - `reports/focus-telemetry/work-ai-feedback.json`
  - `logs/governance/work-feedback.log`

> *AI observes, interprets, and improves every pipeline cycle.*

## üóÇ Directory Layout

```bash
data/work/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tmp/                  # Ephemeral ETL intermediates
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cache/                # Validation/model caches, preview tiles/thumbnails
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ staging/              # Transitional outputs before publishing
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ logs/                 # Debug, validation, runtime and AI audit logs
```

> `.gitignore` excludes all generated files. Only structure and governance documentation persist.

## üßÆ FAIR+CARE Metrics and Evidence

| Metric | Description | Validation Source | Score | Status |
|:--------|:-------------|:------------------|:-------|:--------|
| **Findability Index** | Logs and files traceable by timestamp | `logs/work/` | 9.9 | ‚úÖ |
| **Accessibility Index** | Clear cleanup and retention policies | README | 9.8 | ‚úÖ |
| **Interoperability Index** | JSON/GeoJSON-compatible intermediates | `tests.yml` | 9.7 | ‚úÖ |
| **Reusability Index** | 100% reproducibility from Make targets | `Makefile` | 10 | ‚úÖ |
| **CARE: Benefit** | Supports reproducible research | FAIR audit | 9.8 | ‚úÖ |
| **CARE: Ethics** | AI ensures ethical retention/deletion | `focus-validate.yml` | 9.9 | ‚úÖ |

## üîí Security Manifest Example

```json
{
  "manifest_id": "work-dir-integrity",
  "signer": "@kfm-security",
  "checksum_policy": "sha256",
  "files_removed": 431,
  "verification_status": "trusted",
  "created_at": "2025-10-22T18:45:00Z"
}
```

PGP-signed manifests stored at `data/checksums/work-cleanup.json` after each cleanup.

---

## üîÅ Autonomous Regeneration & Cleanup Governance

- **AI Trigger:** Activated when Focus Mode detects redundancy or corruption.  
- **Human Oversight:** @kfm-security reviews AI cleanup logs weekly.  
- **Governance Logging:** All cleanups appended to `logs/governance/work-cleanup-trail.log`.  
- **Retention Policy:** 48-hour rolling retention. Older files purged unless flagged by FAIR audit.  
- **Ethics Guard:** AI Ethics Lead validates that deletion policies align with CARE standards.
