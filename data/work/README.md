# ‚öôÔ∏è Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Work Data Layer**
`data/work/README.md`

**Purpose:** Core operational data layer of the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM), hosting transient, staging, and validated data used in ETL, AI/ML, and FAIR+CARE governance workflows.  
This layer bridges the gap between raw data ingestion and final processed outputs‚Äîensuring every transformation is transparent, traceable, and ethically governed.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/` directory represents the **engine room** of the KFM‚Äôs data operations‚Äîwhere active ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and AI governance pipelines are executed.  
It provides controlled spaces for transformation, quality assurance, FAIR+CARE auditing, and domain-specific data staging.

### Key Responsibilities:
- Manage intermediate, validated, and staging datasets across all KFM domains.  
- Maintain transparent lineage from raw inputs to processed artifacts.  
- Facilitate FAIR+CARE data validation, audit logging, and provenance recording.  
- Support model-ready feature generation and transformation reproducibility.  

All subdirectories under this workspace conform to the **Master Coder Protocol (MCP-DL v6.3)** and are governed under FAIR+CARE and open data ethics policies.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Work Layer Workflow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Raw Data (data/raw/*)"] --> B["Temporary ETL (data/work/tmp/*)"]
    B --> C["Validation and FAIR+CARE Audit (data/work/tmp/logs/ and validation/)"]
    C --> D["Staging and Schema Alignment (data/work/staging/*)"]
    D --> E["Processed and Certified Data (data/work/processed/*)"]
    E --> F["Governance Ledger Registration (data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json)"]
```

### Workflow Description:
1. **Temporary Layer (TMP):** Data enters ETL pipelines for cleaning, transformation, and QA.  
2. **Validation:** Each TMP dataset undergoes FAIR+CARE audits, schema validation, and checksum registration.  
3. **Staging:** Validated data is prepared for publication, ensuring schema and ethics compliance.  
4. **Processed:** Final datasets are governance-certified, exported, and indexed into catalogs.  
5. **Governance:** Every data transition is logged into the provenance ledger and FAIR+CARE audit reports.

## üß† FAIR+CARE Governance Integration

| Principle | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Findable** | All work-layer datasets are indexed with versioned IDs, schema metadata, and FAIR+CARE tags. |
| **Accessible** | Open, reproducible formats (CSV, JSON, Parquet, GeoJSON) stored under transparent policies. |
| **Interoperable** | Data aligns with STAC 1.0, DCAT 3.0, and KFM schema contracts. |
| **Reusable** | Every artifact has checksum and provenance records linked to the governance ledger. |
| **Collective Benefit** | Enables ethical, transparent, and equitable access to Kansas environmental knowledge. |
| **Authority to Control** | FAIR+CARE Council governs schema promotion, access, and lifecycle rules. |
| **Responsibility** | Validators maintain audit logs of all transformations. |
| **Ethics** | All datasets pass FAIR+CARE ethics and governance audits prior to release. |

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Governance & Provenance Integration

| Record | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json` | Central record of all ETL lineage and FAIR+CARE certifications. |
| `data/reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json` | Annual audit summary for data ethics and accessibility. |
| `data/reports/validation/schema_validation_summary.json` | Schema and contract compliance tracking for all work-layer transitions. |
| `releases/v9.3.2/manifest.zip` | Global checksum registry linking TMP, staging, and processed datasets. |

All governance and synchronization events automated via GitHub Actions workflows (`*.yml` in `.github/workflows/`).

---

## üßæ Retention Policy

| Layer | Retention Duration | Policy |
|--------|--------------------|--------|
| TMP (Transient Data) | 7‚Äì14 days | Purged after validation or staging promotion. |
| Staging (Semi-Permanent) | 180 days | Retained for governance audit review. |
| Processed (Permanent) | Indefinite | Archived as FAIR+CARE-certified canonical datasets. |
| Logs & Validation Records | 365 days | Archived for provenance and reproducibility. |

Lifecycle and cleanup tasks managed via `work_layer_cleanup.yml`.
