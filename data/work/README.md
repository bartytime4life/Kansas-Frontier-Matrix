# ‚öôÔ∏è Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî Work Directory  
`data/work/`

**Mission:** Provide a **sandboxed, ephemeral workspace** for intermediate artifacts,  
debug outputs, and cache data generated during **ETL, STAC validation, ML preprocessing,  
and CI/CD workflows** within the **Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM)**.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/` directory serves as KFM‚Äôs **volatile, developer-centric workspace**,  
intended exclusively for **temporary and regenerable artifacts** created during  
data transformation, testing, and validation.

This area supports **real-time pipeline debugging**, **checksum staging**, and  
**draft STAC item validation**‚Äîwhile maintaining the core MCP principle of  
reproducibility.  

> **Important:** This directory‚Äôs contents are **not version-controlled**.  
> Only structure and documentation persist. All data here can be safely deleted  
> and rebuilt using `make` or ETL pipeline scripts.

## üóÇÔ∏è Directory Layout

```bash
data/work/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tmp/                  # On-the-fly ETL artifacts and working data
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cache/                # Validation, model, and preview caches
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ staging/              # Transitional data outputs prior to publishing
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ logs/                 # Debug, validation, and runtime logs
````

> The `.gitignore` file ensures subdirectory contents are **excluded from version control**,
> preventing accidental commits of transient artifacts.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Usage Policies

| Policy             | Description                                                              |
| :----------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ephemeral**      | Contents are temporary and may be deleted or replaced at any time.       |
| **Non-persistent** | Final outputs belong in `data/processed/` or domain directories.         |
| **MCP-compliant**  | Every temporary artifact must be reproducible via documented workflow.   |
| **CI-safe**        | Used for automated testing, validation, and artifact caching in CI runs. |
| **Isolated**       | Not referenced by public-facing APIs, maps, or published STAC catalogs.  |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Common Use Cases

| Workflow Stage           | Example Output                                           |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ETL Testing**          | Temporary CSV joins or clipped GeoTIFFs.                 |
| **Checksum Validation**  | SHA-256 staging before inclusion in manifest.            |
| **Thumbnail Generation** | Intermediate visual renderings prior to optimization.    |
| **STAC Validation**      | Draft item JSONs before catalog inclusion.               |
| **ML Staging**           | Feature tables, tokenized corpora, or validation splits. |

## üß∞ Maintenance Procedures

The `data/work/` directory should remain **clean, reproducible, and disposable**.
Automated and manual cleanup are both supported.

### üîÅ Automated Cleanup

```bash
make clean-work
```

### üßπ Manual Cleanup

```bash
rm -rf data/work/tmp/* data/work/cache/* data/work/staging/* data/work/logs/*
```

> **Safety:** All data stored here is temporary and can be regenerated
> from `data/raw/` or `data/processed/` using Make targets or ETL scripts.

## üîí Integration with CI/CD & MCP

| Component             | Function                                                                     |
| :-------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.github/workflows/*` | CI logs, test metrics, or validation reports may be temporarily stored here. |
| `src/pipelines/*`     | ETL tasks may stream intermediates to this workspace.                        |
| `data/checksums/`     | Intermediate checksum computations are staged here.                          |
| `data/stac/`          | Draft STAC Items are generated here before publication.                      |
| `Makefile`            | Provides cleanup and utility tasks for managing `data/work/`.                |

## üß† MCP Compliance Summary

| MCP Principle           | Implementation                                                      |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Documentation-first** | README defines lifecycle, structure, and reproducibility.           |
| **Reproducibility**     | All files regenerable from upstream inputs and Make targets.        |
| **Open Standards**      | Uses CSV, JSON, GeoJSON, Parquet, or COG for interoperability.      |
| **Provenance**          | Each artifact is tied to a logged or scripted pipeline step.        |
| **Auditability**        | `data/work/logs/` preserves process-level records for traceability. |
