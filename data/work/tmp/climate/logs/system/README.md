## üß≠ System Context

This directory serves as the **infrastructure audit layer** of the KFM project, logging every operational event that affects system reliability, data safety, and performance.  
All logs within this folder are automatically hashed, timestamped, and integrated into the **Governance Ledger** for long-term auditability.

**Core Functions:**
- Track **system uptime**, **hardware utilization**, and **error rates**.  
- Record **pipeline performance**, **ETL throughput**, and **AI inference latency**.  
- Monitor **security events**, integrity checks, and configuration drift.  
- Provide **real-time diagnostics** for FAIR+CARE-aligned operational governance.  

> *‚ÄúA system without self-awareness cannot guarantee integrity ‚Äî we log so we can trust.‚Äù*
