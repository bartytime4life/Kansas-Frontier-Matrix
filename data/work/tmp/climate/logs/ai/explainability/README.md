## 🧭 System Context

This directory captures **AI explainability artifacts** for *focus-climate-v4* and successor models.  
Explainability logs form the backbone of **AI transparency**, allowing researchers to understand *why* a model made its predictions.

**Core Objectives:**
- Record variable importance per prediction (SHAP/LIME outputs).  
- Summarize model reasoning across datasets.  
- Quantify explainability performance (`focus_score_mean`).  
- Register results into the immutable Governance Ledger.

> *“An explainable model is not just smart — it’s accountable.”*
