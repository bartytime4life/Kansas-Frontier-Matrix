# 📊 Kansas Frontier Matrix — **Climate Energy Summary Reports**  
`data/work/tmp/climate/logs/energy/summary/`

**Mission:** Deliver **aggregated sustainability metrics**—energy consumption, carbon impact, renewable offsets, and ethical compliance—derived from the Kansas Frontier Matrix climate workflows.  
Each summary is FAIR+CARE certified, ISO-audited, and ledger-tracked to ensure reproducibility and accountability.

## 🧭 System Context

This directory consolidates **quarterly and annual sustainability summaries** from individual energy run logs (`runs/`) and compliance records.  
These reports provide the foundation for **ISO verification, FAIR+CARE audits, and Governance Ledger entries**, forming the backbone of the system’s sustainability accountability.

**Core Goals:**
- Aggregate all energy and carbon metrics into reproducible CSV and JSON reports.  
- Generate quarterly sustainability scorecards and visual trends.  
- Feed verified data into the **Immutable Governance Ledger** for certification cycles.  
- Support FAIR+CARE compliance and ISO revalidation.

> *“Summaries are not just metrics — they are proof of stewardship.”*
