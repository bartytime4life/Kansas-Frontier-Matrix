# üì¶ Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Climate TMP Staging Workspace**
`data/work/tmp/climate/staging/README.md`

**Purpose:** Transitional workspace for validated and FAIR+CARE-compliant climate data within the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
This layer bridges temporary ETL outputs and the formal `data/work/staging/climate/` repository, enabling reproducible data flow with full governance and provenance traceability.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/tmp/climate/staging/` directory contains **temporary, validated climate datasets** awaiting promotion to KFM‚Äôs main staging layer.  
It acts as a quality-controlled holding zone, ensuring each dataset meets schema standards, FAIR+CARE ethics requirements, and provenance continuity before being published or processed further.

### Core Functions:
- Store FAIR+CARE-audited climate datasets post-validation.  
- Maintain temporary but traceable files ready for governance sign-off.  
- Provide structured inputs for `data/work/staging/climate/`.  
- Record lineage, checksums, and metadata synchronization logs.  

All files in this workspace are **intermediate** and automatically promoted or purged once verified by automated governance workflows.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Staging Workflow

    A["Validated Climate Data (data/work/tmp/climate/validation/)"] --> B["Prepare for Promotion (data/work/tmp/climate/staging/)"]
    B --> C["FAIR+CARE Governance Review"]
    C --> D["Checksum Verification and Metadata Sync"]
    D --> E["Promotion to data/work/staging/climate/"]
```

### Workflow Steps:
1. **Validation Completion:** Only datasets passing all FAIR+CARE pre-audits enter this staging layer.  
2. **Checksum & Provenance:** Each file cross-checked against validation outputs and governance manifest.  
3. **Review:** FAIR+CARE Council confirms compliance and documentation completeness.  
4. **Promotion:** Certified files transferred to permanent staging repository.  
5. **Cleanup:** Temporary artifacts deleted upon successful handoff.

## üß† FAIR+CARE Governance in Climate TMP Staging

| Principle | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Findable** | All staged files registered with schema metadata and FAIR+CARE status. |
| **Accessible** | Stored in accessible CSV, Parquet, and JSON formats. |
| **Interoperable** | Schema aligned with KFM‚Äôs data contract and STAC/DCAT metadata. |
| **Reusable** | Provenance metadata links every file to its ETL and validation sources. |
| **Collective Benefit** | Guarantees ethical, transparent, and open data handoff processes. |
| **Authority to Control** | FAIR+CARE Council approves staging promotion. |
| **Responsibility** | Validators ensure proper field mappings and data integrity. |
| **Ethics** | All staged outputs cleared for ethical compliance. |

Governance confirmations logged within:  
`data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json`  
and `data/reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Validation & QA Integration

| Report | Description | Output |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `faircare_audit_report.json` | Summarizes FAIR+CARE audit compliance for staged datasets. | JSON |
| `schema_validation_summary.json` | Validates field conformity with KFM‚Äôs schema. | JSON |
| `checksums.json` | Maintains hash consistency for data lineage verification. | JSON |
| `governance_sync.log` | Records FAIR+CARE certification and promotion approval. | Text |

Automated staging promotion handled via `climate_staging_sync.yml`.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Governance & Provenance Integration

| Record | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `metadata.json` | Tracks runtime metadata, schema version, and checksum linkage. |
| `data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json` | Logs lineage and FAIR+CARE certification results. |
| `data/reports/validation/schema_validation_summary.json` | Field-level QA and validation records. |
| `releases/v9.3.2/manifest.zip` | Checksum registry ensuring integrity across TMP and staging. |

---

## üßæ Retention Policy

| File Type | Retention Duration | Policy |
|------------|--------------------|--------|
| Staged Data | 7 days | Promoted automatically to staging repository after governance sign-off. |
| Metadata Files | 365 days | Retained for provenance and reproducibility. |
| Logs & Reports | 30 days | Archived to governance and system logs. |
| Temporary Files | 14 days | Purged post-promotion. |

Cleanup automated by `climate_staging_cleanup.yml`.
