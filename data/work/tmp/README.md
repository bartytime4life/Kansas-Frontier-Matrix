# üß© Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî Temporary Workspace (`data/work/tmp/`)

**Mission:** Provide a **short-term scratch space** for temporary files generated  
during ETL, validation, testing, or data transformation processes ‚Äî  
ensuring reproducibility without polluting the main data directories.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/tmp/` directory is a **sandbox environment** for short-lived files  
created during Kansas Frontier Matrix workflows. It supports debugging, validation, and  
staging of intermediate data products that are not stored permanently in the repository.

Files placed here are **ephemeral**, automatically regenerated when needed,  
and excluded from version control via `.gitignore`.

Common uses include:
- Partial ETL outputs and batch processing fragments  
- Temporary raster/vector exports for validation  
- In-memory cache dumps or preview renderings  
- Experimentation with new dataset transformations

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage Guidelines

| Policy                 | Description                                                                            |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ephemeral Only**     | Do not store permanent datasets here. Contents may be deleted at any time.             |
| **Reproducible State** | All files must be regenerable using documented Makefile targets or scripts.            |
| **CI/CD Ignored**      | This directory is excluded from automated validation, except for specific debug tests. |
| **Logs & Cache**       | Temporary debug logs or processing caches may be stored here.                          |
| **File Size Limit**    | Keep individual files ‚â§ 1 GB to maintain build and cleanup efficiency.                 |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Typical Use Cases

| Task                    | Example                                          |
| :---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| **Raster Processing**   | Subset DEMs for regional validation.             |
| **STAC Testing**        | Validate metadata generation before commit.      |
| **Checksum Debugging**  | Regenerate test hashes for pipeline validation.  |
| **Thumbnail Testing**   | Render low-resolution previews for QA.           |
| **Tabular ETL Testing** | Transform partial datasets for schema alignment. |

---

## üßπ Cleanup Policy

Temporary files are cleared automatically during maintenance operations
and may also be purged manually.

**Makefile target:**

```bash
make clean-tmp
```

**Manual command:**

```bash
rm -rf data/work/tmp/*
```

All data here is reproducible through the documented ETL pipelines.

| MCP Principle           | Implementation                                                       |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Documentation-first** | README documents structure and use of temporary workspace.           |
| **Reproducibility**     | All temporary artifacts are regenerable from ETL scripts.            |
| **Open Standards**      | Temporary files conform to project-wide formats (GeoJSON, COG, CSV). |
| **Provenance**          | Even short-lived data follows consistent file naming conventions.    |
| **Auditability**        | Logs and debug outputs can be reviewed before cleanup.               |
