# üß© Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Temporary Workspace**  
`data/work/tmp/`

**Mission:** Provide a **controlled, short-term sandbox** for temporary files generated  
during ETL, validation, testing, and data transformation ‚Äî enabling rapid experimentation,  
debugging, and reproducibility without contaminating long-term data directories.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/tmp/` directory serves as a **sandboxed, ephemeral workspace**  
for temporary, regenerable artifacts created during KFM‚Äôs ETL, validation, and testing processes.  

It enables **safe experimentation**, **debugging**, and **short-term persistence**  
of intermediate files without affecting permanent data directories.

Files here are **non-persistent**, **excluded from version control**,  
and fully **reproducible** using Makefile or ETL pipelines.

> üß≠ *‚ÄúTemporary by design ‚Äî reproducible by principle.‚Äù*

## üóÇÔ∏è Directory Layout

```bash
data/work/tmp/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ terrain/           # Temporary DEM, slope, and hillshade intermediates
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hydrology/         # Watershed, river, or flood polygon staging
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ landcover/         # NLCD or vegetation classification intermediates
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ climate/           # Temperature, precipitation, and drought test data
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hazards/           # Tornado, wildfire, or flood overlay test files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tabular/           # CSV or Parquet slices for schema validation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ text/              # OCR/NLP intermediate text files and debug outputs
```

> Each subdirectory mirrors its counterpart in `data/processed/`, maintaining **schema consistency** between transient and finalized datasets.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage Guidelines

| Policy                 | Description                                                                     |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Ephemeral Only**     | Store only disposable, temporary files.                                         |
| **Reproducible State** | All contents must be regenerable via documented Make or ETL workflows.          |
| **CI/CD Exclusion**    | Automatically ignored except when explicitly used for testing.                  |
| **Logging Permitted**  | Debug or validation logs may reside here safely.                                |
| **Storage Discipline** | Individual files ‚â§ 1 GB; directory auto-cleared during scheduled maintenance.    |

## üß© Typical Use Cases

| Workflow Stage       | Example Use                                                    |
| :------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ETL Prototyping**  | Test raster reprojection, clipping, or CSV normalization.      |
| **Checksum Drafts**  | Generate SHA-256 digests before official manifest inclusion.   |
| **STAC Validation**  | Build and review temporary STAC Items pre-publication.         |
| **Visualization QA** | Render draft thumbnails or map tiles for pre-release review.   |
| **ML Staging**       | Tokenized text, small validation splits, or cached embeddings. |

---

## üßπ Cleanup Policy

This directory is routinely cleaned and can be cleared at any time.  
All contents can be reproduced from deterministic ETL pipelines.

### üß© Automated Cleanup

```bash
make clean-tmp
```

### üßº Manual Cleanup

```bash
rm -rf data/work/tmp/*
```

**Safety:** All files here are **temporary** ‚Äî no archival or versioning required.

## üß∞ Integration with CI/CD & ETL

| Component            | Role / Function                                                            |
| :------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.github/workflows/` | Stores CI debug outputs and test artifacts temporarily.                    |
| `src/pipelines/*`    | Writes intermediate files here during ETL or preprocessing runs.            |
| `data/work/logs/`    | Logs all transient tasks for traceability and debugging.                   |
| `data/checksums/`    | Uses this area to generate hashes before manifest promotion.               |
| `data/stac/`         | Validates draft STAC JSONs before committing to main catalog.              |

## üß† MCP Compliance Matrix

| MCP Principle       | Implementation Example                                            |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Documentation-first** | README documents lifecycle and reproducibility scope.           |
| **Reproducibility**     | All temporary artifacts regenerable via Make or pipeline runs.  |
| **Open Standards**      | Supports COG, GeoJSON, CSV, JSONL, and Parquet intermediate data. |
| **Provenance**          | Subfolders inherit lineage from matching `data/processed/` domain. |
| **Auditability**        | Logs stored in `data/work/logs/` before automated cleanup.      |

---

## üß© Maintenance Recommendations

1. **Automate Cleanup:** Schedule weekly cleanup in CI/CD to manage disk usage.  
2. **Log Traceability:** Always write transformation logs to `data/work/logs/`.  
3. **Prefix Convention:** Use timestamps or ETL run IDs in file names.  
4. **Avoid Backups:** Never store long-term or irreplaceable data here.  
5. **Monitor Size:** CI should trigger an alert if `tmp/` exceeds 5 GB.
