# üßÆ Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Temporary Work Environment**
`data/work/tmp/README.md`

**Purpose:** Provides a transient, FAIR+CARE-governed workspace for intermediate ETL processes, AI/ML workflows, and pre-validation data preparation within the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
All datasets and logs in this layer are temporary ‚Äî facilitating reproducible computation while maintaining provenance, governance, and ethical integrity.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/tmp/` directory acts as the **ephemeral workspace** for all intermediate operations in KFM‚Äôs processing stack.  
It bridges raw data ingestion, validation, and processed outputs through FAIR+CARE-aligned temporary caching, staging, and governance-aware pipelines.

### Core Purposes:
- Store short-lived data artifacts generated during ETL, AI, and validation workflows.  
- Support intermediate QA, checksum verification, and FAIR+CARE ethics pre-validation.  
- Log temporary governance activities, metadata enrichments, and automation outputs.  
- Provide reproducibility for all transient computation within ETL pipelines.  

Each subdirectory represents a specialized component within the temporary work environment.

## ‚öôÔ∏è TMP Workflow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Raw Data (data/raw/*)"] --> B["ETL and AI/ML Processing (data/work/tmp/*)"]
    B --> C["Validation and FAIR+CARE Pre-Audit (data/work/tmp/logs/validation/)"]
    C --> D["Promotion to Staging Workspace (data/work/staging/*)"]
    D --> E["Governance Ledger Registration (data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json)"]
```

### Workflow Description:
1. **Ingestion:** Data imported from raw sources for temporary preprocessing.  
2. **Processing:** Transformations, feature extraction, and AI inference cached here.  
3. **Validation:** Temporary checks executed for schema, ethics, and provenance.  
4. **Governance:** Metadata and checksums recorded to audit ledger.  
5. **Cleanup:** TMP files automatically deleted or archived after staging promotion.

## üß† FAIR+CARE Governance Alignment

| Principle | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Findable** | TMP assets tagged with dataset ID, timestamp, and checksum. |
| **Accessible** | Accessible only to pipeline operators and governance reviewers. |
| **Interoperable** | Data stored in open interoperable formats (CSV, JSON, GeoJSON, Parquet). |
| **Reusable** | Metadata and logs provide full reproducibility of TMP operations. |
| **Collective Benefit** | Facilitates efficient data workflows for open-science integrity. |
| **Authority to Control** | FAIR+CARE Council oversees TMP lifecycle management. |
| **Responsibility** | Logs ensure every temporary action is accountable and ethical. |
| **Ethics** | TMP processing excludes sensitive or personal data. |

Governance and audit data recorded in:  
`data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json`  
and `data/reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json`.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Governance & Provenance Integration

| Record | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `metadata.json` | Tracks TMP workflow context and checksum for reproducibility. |
| `data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json` | Logs transient workflow events and validation results. |
| `data/reports/validation/schema_validation_summary.json` | Captures temporary schema validation outcomes. |
| `releases/v9.3.2/manifest.zip` | Includes TMP file hashes for validation traceability. |

TMP synchronization and cleanup automated via `tmp_cleanup.yml`.

---

## üßæ Retention Policy

| Category | Retention Duration | Policy |
|-----------|--------------------|--------|
| TMP Data | 7 days | Automatically purged after successful promotion. |
| Cache Files | 30 days | Retained for reproducibility of AI and ETL operations. |
| Logs | 90 days | Archived in `data/work/logs/system/`. |
| Metadata | 365 days | Retained permanently for provenance and governance traceability. |

All retention and purge actions managed by `tmp_retention_sync.yml`.
