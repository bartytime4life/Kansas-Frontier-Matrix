# üßÆ Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Temporary Work Environment**
`data/work/tmp/README.md`

**Purpose:** Ephemeral FAIR+CARE-governed workspace for intermediate ETL transformations, model outputs, and validation checkpoints across multiple data domains in the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
All datasets and logs within this layer are temporary ‚Äî enabling reproducibility and transparent data flow while maintaining strict ethical and provenance standards.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/tmp/` directory functions as a **multi-domain, transient workspace** for intermediate processing across KFM‚Äôs major scientific and archival modules.  
It temporarily hosts normalized data fragments, validation reports, and AI model artifacts used during ETL, analytics, and quality assurance.  

### Key Responsibilities:
- Provide an isolated sandbox for **domain-specific ETL pipelines** (e.g., hydrology, hazards, terrain).  
- Support **pre-validation** and **checksum audits** for FAIR+CARE compliance.  
- Store **AI/ML intermediate artifacts**, model predictions, and logs.  
- Maintain **provenance continuity** while ensuring non-persistent data lifecycles.  

All contents are regenerated automatically by KFM‚Äôs pipelines and removed after successful staging or validation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è TMP Workflow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Raw Data (data/raw/*)"] --> B["Temporary ETL Processing (data/work/tmp/*)"]
    B --> C["Validation and FAIR+CARE Auditing (domain-specific tmp layers)"]
    C --> D["Promotion to Staging Layer (data/work/staging/*)"]
    D --> E["Governance Ledger Registration (data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json)"]
```

### Workflow Description:
1. **Ingestion:** Raw data pulled into the corresponding domain-specific TMP folder.  
2. **Transformation:** Schema normalization, feature engineering, and pre-validation occur.  
3. **FAIR+CARE Audit:** Each dataset undergoes automated ethical and reproducibility checks.  
4. **Promotion:** Once validated, files move to the appropriate staging layer.  
5. **Governance:** Metadata, lineage, and checksum results logged to governance records.

## üß† FAIR+CARE Governance Alignment

| Principle | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Findable** | TMP data indexed by domain, pipeline, and checksum metadata. |
| **Accessible** | Stored in open interoperable formats for internal access only. |
| **Interoperable** | Conforms to KFM‚Äôs JSON schema and FAIR+CARE metadata framework. |
| **Reusable** | Fully traceable via governance ledger and manifest registry. |
| **Collective Benefit** | Enables safe, reproducible data processing without polluting raw or staging layers. |
| **Authority to Control** | FAIR+CARE Council manages domain-specific retention and purging rules. |
| **Responsibility** | All transformations and logs linked to validator identity and runtime context. |
| **Ethics** | Excludes sensitive or personally identifiable information. |

Governance integration is logged automatically to:  
`data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json` and `data/reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json`.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Governance & Provenance Integration

| Record | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `metadata.json` | Captures temporary workflow metadata and validation status. |
| `data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json` | Records lineage for all TMP events. |
| `data/reports/validation/schema_validation_summary.json` | Captures schema testing and pre-validation results. |
| `releases/v9.3.2/manifest.zip` | Contains TMP checksum hashes and integrity records. |

TMP synchronization and cleanup tasks managed via `tmp_sync.yml`.

---

## üßæ Retention Policy

| Category | Retention Duration | Policy |
|-----------|--------------------|--------|
| Domain TMP Data | 7 days | Purged automatically post-validation or staging promotion. |
| AI/ML Intermediate Outputs | 14 days | Retained for reproducibility testing. |
| Logs and Validation Reports | 30 days | Archived to `data/work/logs/system/`. |
| Metadata Records | 365 days | Retained permanently for provenance auditing. |

Retention and cleanup automation handled by `tmp_retention_cleanup.yml`.
