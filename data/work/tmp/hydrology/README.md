# üíß Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî Temporary Hydrology Workspace  
`data/work/tmp/hydrology/`

**Mission:** Serve as a **sandbox workspace** for intermediate and temporary hydrology data ‚Äî  
including rivers, watersheds, aquifers, floodplain previews, and flow model test outputs ‚Äî  
generated during ETL, validation, and QA/QC processes in the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/tmp/hydrology/` directory is a **temporary workspace** used for processing  
and validating hydrology-related datasets during pipeline execution.  

Typical contents include:
- Subsets of river or watershed GeoJSONs for testing  
- Temporary flood zone or aquifer extent rasters  
- Preprocessing or reprojection intermediates  
- Validation logs and flow model snapshots  

Files stored here are **not version-controlled**, **safe to delete**, and are fully **reproducible**  
through KFM‚Äôs hydrology ETL and validation pipelines.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage Guidelines

| Policy                   | Description                                                |
| :----------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ephemeral Storage**    | Files are short-lived and excluded from version control.   |
| **Reproducible Outputs** | All data must be regenerable using ETL commands.           |
| **CI/CD Exclusion**      | This directory is ignored by CI except during diagnostics. |
| **Temporary Purpose**    | Designed for staging or validation, not long-term storage. |
| **Cleanup Policy**       | Contents are auto-deleted or replaced on pipeline rerun.   |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Typical Use Cases

| Task                            | Example                                                             |
| :------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Watershed Validation**        | Test-run watershed boundaries before generating full HUC-12 layers. |
| **Flood Zone Testing**          | Generate temporary rasters to verify FEMA floodplain alignment.     |
| **Groundwater Model Debugging** | Export aquifer or well test rasters for quick inspection.           |
| **River Network QA**            | Validate vector flow directionality and geometry consistency.       |
| **Checksum Comparison**         | Recalculate hashes to confirm reproducibility before integration.   |

## üßπ Cleanup Policy

Temporary hydrology data should be cleaned regularly to avoid build clutter.

**Makefile target:**

```bash
make clean-tmp
```

**Manual cleanup:**

```bash
rm -rf data/work/tmp/hydrology/*
```

All validated and permanent hydrology datasets are stored in:

* `data/processed/hydrology/` ‚Äî finalized and validated datasets
* `data/checksums/hydrology/` ‚Äî SHA-256 checksums for integrity verification
* `data/processed/metadata/hydrology/` ‚Äî STAC-compliant metadata files

| MCP Principle           | Implementation                                                       |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Documentation-first** | README documents structure, policy, and intended use.                |
| **Reproducibility**     | All temporary files can be recreated from ETL logs or Makefile runs. |
| **Open Standards**      | Uses GeoJSON, GeoTIFF, CSV ‚Äî no proprietary formats.                 |
| **Provenance**          | Files correspond directly to ETL stages and validation logs.         |
| **Auditability**        | ETL logs under `/logs/` preserve traceable hydrology operations.     |
