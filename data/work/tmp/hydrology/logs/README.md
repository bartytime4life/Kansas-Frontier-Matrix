# üíß Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî Hydrology ETL Logs  
`data/work/tmp/hydrology/logs/`

**Mission:** Record and manage **temporary hydrologic ETL logs** produced during dataset ingestion,  
validation, and analysis ‚Äî ensuring transparent, reproducible, and auditable workflows for Kansas water,  
streamflow, and groundwater data in the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM) system.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/tmp/hydrology/logs/` directory temporarily stores **pipeline and validation logs**  
produced while processing hydrologic datasets such as stream gauge data, watersheds, river networks,  
and groundwater measurements.  

These logs document:
- Extraction and preprocessing of raw NWIS, FEMA, and USGS data  
- CRS reprojection, interpolation, and catchment aggregation steps  
- Quality control and schema validation for tabular/raster hydrology data  
- Checksum and reproducibility verification  

All logs are **ephemeral**, **excluded from Git**, and **regenerated deterministically**  
whenever `make hydrology` or equivalent ETL commands are executed.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Logging Guidelines

| Log Type                      | Purpose                                                               |
| :---------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`*_etl_debug.log`**         | Records main ETL execution, transformations, and performance metrics. |
| **`*_validation_report.log`** | Summarizes schema and value validation for hydrologic datasets.       |
| **`*_cleaning.log`**          | Documents null fills, normalization, and statistical corrections.     |
| **`*_checksum_audit.log`**    | Contains hash verification results for reproducibility audits.        |

All logs use **UTF-8 text** format and standardized timestamping for audit traceability.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Log Generation Workflow

Logs are generated automatically by the hydrology ETL pipeline or can be manually invoked.

**Makefile target:**

```bash
make hydrology
```

**Python command:**

```bash
python src/pipelines/hydrology/hydrology_pipeline.py --log data/work/tmp/hydrology/logs/hydrology_etl_debug.log
```

**Lifecycle**

1. ETL process initializes ‚Üí log file created.
2. Operations (download, cleaning, reprojection, merge) append live updates.
3. QA or CI/CD processes read logs for diagnostics.
4. Logs are cleared after validation or cleanup.

---

## üßπ Cleanup Policy

Logs are temporary and automatically deleted after successful pipeline validation.

**Makefile target:**

```bash
make clean-logs
```

**Manual cleanup:**

```bash
rm -rf data/work/tmp/hydrology/logs/*
```

Permanent, validated data reside in:

* `data/processed/hydrology/` ‚Äî Final hydrologic datasets
* `data/checksums/hydrology/` ‚Äî Reproducibility hashes
* `data/processed/metadata/hydrology/` ‚Äî STAC metadata for hydrology layers
