# üßæ Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî Tabular ETL Logs  
`data/work/tmp/tabular/logs/`

**Mission:** Store **temporary log files** generated during tabular ETL, validation, and QA/QC workflows ‚Äî  
ensuring full transparency and traceability for census, agricultural, and economic datasets processed within  
the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM) system.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/tmp/tabular/logs/` directory holds **transient ETL and validation logs**  
produced when tabular data (e.g., census, agricultural, or economic tables)  
is being processed, cleaned, normalized, or verified.  

Logs here support:
- Schema and format validation of CSV and Parquet files  
- Quality control and unit consistency checks  
- Cross-decade statistical QA for time-series datasets  
- Checksum verification reports for reproducibility audits  

All logs are **ephemeral**, **excluded from version control**, and **automatically regenerated**  
each time tabular ETL workflows are executed.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Logging Guidelines

| Log Type                    | Purpose                                                                        |
| :-------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`*_etl_debug.log`**       | Captures the full ETL process ‚Äî load, clean, transform, and export operations. |
| **`*_validation.log`**      | Records schema validation, type-checking, and unit consistency reports.        |
| **`*_cleaning_report.log`** | Summarizes missing data fills, normalization routines, or anomalies.           |
| **`*_checksum_audit.log`**  | Details hash verification steps to confirm reproducibility.                    |

All logs are stored as UTF-8 plain text for universal compatibility and open audit access.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Log Generation Workflow

Logs are automatically generated by the ETL pipeline and can also be initiated manually.

**Makefile target:**

```bash
make tabular
```

**Python example:**

```bash
python src/pipelines/tabular/tabular_pipeline.py --log data/work/tmp/tabular/logs/tabular_etl_debug.log
```

**Lifecycle:**

1. Pipeline execution begins and initializes new log files.
2. Each transformation, schema check, and export is recorded in sequence.
3. Logs are used for QA, CI/CD diagnostics, or troubleshooting.
4. Logs are deleted or archived on successful pipeline completion.

---

## üßπ Cleanup Policy

Logs in this directory are temporary and are removed during scheduled cleanups.

**Makefile target:**

```bash
make clean-logs
```

**Manual cleanup:**

```bash
rm -rf data/work/tmp/tabular/logs/*
```

Permanent outputs and documentation reside in:

* `data/processed/tabular/` ‚Äî Finalized data tables
* `data/checksums/tabular/` ‚Äî Integrity validation hashes
* `data/processed/metadata/tabular/` ‚Äî STAC-compliant metadata and schema references

| :------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/pipelines/tabular/tabular_pipeline.py` | Generates ETL, validation, and audit logs during execution.             |
| `.github/workflows/stac-validate.yml`       | Uses logs for checksum and schema validation diagnostics.               |
| `data/work/tmp/tabular/`                    | Parent directory for temporary tabular datasets and intermediate files. |
| `data/processed/tabular/`                   | Stores finalized and validated tabular outputs.                         |
