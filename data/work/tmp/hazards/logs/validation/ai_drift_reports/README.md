# ü§ñ Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **AI Drift Reports for Hazard Validation**
`data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/validation/ai_drift_reports/README.md`

**Purpose:** Repository for AI drift detection, monitoring, and ethics compliance reports generated during hazard validation workflows within the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
This workspace captures data and concept drift analyses across hazard AI models, ensuring continuous FAIR+CARE alignment, transparency, and reproducibility in model validation processes.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/validation/ai_drift_reports/` directory holds **AI drift monitoring reports** created during model validation for hazard risk forecasting, energy resilience, and environmental prediction systems in KFM.  
These reports record model performance shifts, bias variations, and FAIR+CARE compliance metrics between validation cycles.

### Core Functions:
- Detect and record feature or concept drift in hazard prediction AI models.  
- Evaluate ethical model performance consistency using FAIR+CARE principles.  
- Support governance-led retraining and validation transparency.  
- Provide reproducible lineage linking validation cycles and model versions.  

All drift reports are checksum-verified, ethically reviewed, and registered in the **AI Governance Ledger** for provenance tracking and FAIR+CARE certification.

## ‚öôÔ∏è AI Drift Validation Workflow

```mermaid

    A["Hazard AI Model Validation (data/work/tmp/hazards/ai/)"] --> B["Drift Detection (Statistical + Bias Analysis)"]
    B --> C["FAIR+CARE Compliance Audit"]
    C --> D["Governance Review and Certification"]
    D --> E["Retraining Recommendation and Ledger Registration"]
```

### Workflow Description:
1. **Drift Detection:** Evaluate shifts in model features or outputs using statistical tests.  
2. **Bias Audit:** Assess ethical bias drift using demographic and spatial analysis.  
3. **Governance Review:** FAIR+CARE Council reviews drift metrics and performance logs.  
4. **Certification:** Validation logs approved or flagged for retraining under FAIR+CARE.  
5. **Retention:** Results archived and registered within the KFM Provenance Ledger.

## üß† FAIR+CARE Governance Alignment

| Principle | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Findable** | Drift reports indexed by model name, version, and validation cycle. |
| **Accessible** | Stored in open JSON, CSV, and Markdown formats for audit review. |
| **Interoperable** | Structured according to FAIR+CARE and DCAT AI validation schema. |
| **Reusable** | Captures lineage between AI versions and validation metrics. |
| **Collective Benefit** | Ensures ethically consistent AI performance for hazard resilience. |
| **Authority to Control** | FAIR+CARE Council authorizes retraining or model retirement decisions. |
| **Responsibility** | Model validators document drift monitoring outcomes transparently. |
| **Ethics** | Upholds transparency, fairness, and ethical reproducibility standards. |

Governance and audit linkages stored in:  
`data/reports/audit/ai_hazards_ledger.json`  
and `data/reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json`.
