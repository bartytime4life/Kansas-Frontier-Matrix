# 🤖 Kansas Frontier Matrix — **Retraining Recommendation (AI Drift Validation · Q4 2024)**
`data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/validation/ai_drift_reports/retraining_recommendation_2024Q4.md`

**Purpose:** Governance-certified report outlining AI model retraining recommendations based on detected drift, bias shifts, and FAIR+CARE ethics evaluations observed during the Q4 2024 hazard validation cycle.  
This report summarizes the findings of the AI Governance Board for hazard prediction models within the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).

## 📚 Overview

This retraining recommendation document is based on AI drift detection reports and FAIR+CARE bias audits from **Q4 2024 hazard model validations**.  
It provides the rationale for retraining, targeted mitigation strategies, and the associated governance actions to preserve ethical AI operations and reproducibility in KFM’s hazard analytics.

### Objectives:
- Assess data and concept drift impacts on model reliability.  
- Identify ethical bias drift detected in validation audits.  
- Recommend retraining strategies aligned with FAIR+CARE governance.  
- Document Council approval for retraining and certification renewal.

## ⚖️ Governance Recommendations

1. ✅ Retrain `hazards_risk_forecaster_v3` and `climate_drought_analyzer_v3` under supervised data augmentation to address drift and bias.  
2. 🔹 Maintain monitoring on `hydrology_flood_estimator_v1` for minor drift anomalies in Q1 2025.  
3. 🔹 Implement integrated bias mitigation during retraining (demographic parity and loss regularization).  
4. 🔹 Validate new models against FAIR+CARE audit thresholds prior to deployment.  
5. 🔹 Update provenance records and checksum manifests post-training completion.
