# üìò Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Hazard Schema Validation Reports**
`data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/validation/schema_reports/README.md`

**Purpose:** Repository for schema validation reports, field compliance audits, and contract alignment summaries generated during hazard dataset verification in the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
This workspace provides complete transparency into how hazard datasets conform to project-wide schema standards and FAIR+CARE governance contracts.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/validation/schema_reports/` directory contains **schema compliance validation reports** documenting field-level conformance of hazard datasets to KFM‚Äôs data contracts and FAIR+CARE requirements.  
These logs ensure every hazard dataset adheres to approved data models, metadata standards, and interoperability guidelines under MCP-DL v6.3.

### Core Functions:
- Validate hazard datasets against project schema contracts.  
- Record field-level type checks, completeness ratios, and metadata consistency.  
- Ensure alignment with FAIR+CARE interoperability and accessibility principles.  
- Maintain transparency and reproducibility for validation governance.  

All schema reports are checksum-verified, linked to FAIR+CARE certification logs, and permanently registered in the **Data Provenance Ledger**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Schema Validation Workflow

    A["Hazard Datasets (Staging / Processed)"] --> B["Schema Validation Engine (data_contract_v3.json)"]
    B --> C["Field Type and Completeness Audit"]
    C --> D["Contract Alignment with FAIR+CARE"]
    D --> E["Generate Schema Validation Reports"]
    E --> F["Governance Ledger Registration"]
```

### Workflow Description:
1. **Schema Validation:** Hazard datasets are tested against JSON and YAML-based schema contracts.  
2. **Type Audit:** Field types and null-value checks performed across all records.  
3. **Alignment Audit:** Validation ensures schema compliance with FAIR+CARE contract standards.  
4. **Governance Logging:** Results uploaded to provenance ledger for reproducibility.  
5. **Certification:** FAIR+CARE Council confirms compliance metrics before publication.

## üß† FAIR+CARE Governance Alignment

| Principle | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Findable** | Schema reports indexed by ETL cycle and contract version. |
| **Accessible** | Open JSON, CSV, and Markdown formats support transparent audits. |
| **Interoperable** | Aligned with FAIR+CARE metadata and STAC/DCAT specifications. |
| **Reusable** | Contains contract references, field mappings, and provenance checksums. |
| **Collective Benefit** | Ensures cross-domain interoperability and ethical data management. |
| **Authority to Control** | FAIR+CARE Council validates schema compliance results. |
| **Responsibility** | Validators document schema changes and quality metrics. |
| **Ethics** | Guarantees transparent documentation of schema decisions. |

All audit results logged within:  
`data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json` and  
`data/reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json`.
