## üß≠ Overview

This workspace logs all **validation artifacts** produced during hazard-layer data transformation.  
Every validation cycle adheres to **Master Coder Protocol (MCP-DL v6.3)** and records:

- **Schema Conformance:** Ensures all hazard datasets meet STAC, DCAT, and internal schema requirements.  
- **AI Model Validation:** Captures drift detection, fairness evaluation, and reproducibility evidence for AI models.  
- **FAIR+CARE Evaluation:** Verifies findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability compliance.  
- **Governance Integrity:** Audits data lineage, version control consistency, and checksum traceability.  

Outputs generated here are versioned, checksum-verified, and migrated into stable `data/work/staging/hazards/validation/` after CI/CD gate checks.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Validation Workflow

flowchart TD
    A[Hazards ETL Outputs (.geojson / .json)] --> B[Schema Validators (STAC / JSON Schema)]
    B --> C[FAIR+CARE Auditors (faircare-cli)]
    C --> D[AI Drift & Ethics Validator]
    D --> E[Governance Ledger Registration]
    E --> F[Checksum Archive + Provenance Update]
%% END OF MERMAID %%

Each pipeline execution (triggered by `make validate-hazards`) performs:

1. **Schema Validation** ‚Äî Confirms dataset structure and semantic correctness.  
2. **FAIR+CARE Metrics** ‚Äî Quantifies FAIR and CARE compliance.  
3. **AI Model Validation** ‚Äî Evaluates explainability and drift thresholds.  
4. **Governance Update** ‚Äî Records hashes and validation metadata in audit ledger.

## üß∞ Tools & Utilities

| Tool | Purpose | Version |
|------|----------|----------|
| `stac-validate` | STAC schema validation engine | v1.5 |
| `jsonschema-cli` | JSON Schema compliance tool | v0.7 |
| `faircare-cli` | FAIR+CARE metric validator | v2.1 |
| `ai-drift-audit` | AI drift, bias, and explainability evaluator | v3.4 |
| `provenance-log` | Governance and checksum auditor | v1.8 |

All tools are executed through `make hazards-validate` or `make data-validate`.  
Logs are automatically stored under `reports/` and summarized under `summaries/`.

---

## üîí Governance & Provenance

Each validation run produces:

- **Immutable Run ID** (`UUIDv4`)  
- **Checksums (SHA-256)** stored in `manifests/`  
- **AI Ledger Entries** stored in `reports/audit/ai_hazards_validation_ledger.json`  
- **Version Links** referencing commit SHA and manifest entries  

All artifacts are verified in CI and linked to SBOM for end-to-end traceability.

## üßæ Compliance Summary

| Standard | Verified by | Output Reference |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| MCP-DL v6.3 | CI/CD validation suite | self-validation logs |
| STAC 1.0 | stac-validate | schema reports |
| FAIR+CARE | faircare-cli | faircare summaries |
| CIDOC CRM / OWL-Time | semantic linter | audit reports |
| WCAG 2.1 AA | accessibility test suite | UI validation reports |

---

## üì¶ Release Artifacts

Validated artifacts are exported into:  
`releases/v9.3.2/work-hazards-validation.meta.json`  
and synchronized with corresponding transformation layer (`data/work/tmp/hazards/transforms/`).

---

## üß© Integration Points

- **Transformation Input:** Receives processed data from `/data/work/tmp/hazards/transforms/`.  
- **Staging Output:** Pushes final validated results to `/data/work/staging/hazards/validation/`.  
- **Governance Link:** Syncs provenance data with `/docs/standards/governance/`.
