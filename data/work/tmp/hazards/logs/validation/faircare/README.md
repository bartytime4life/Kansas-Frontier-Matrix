# üßÆ Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Hazard FAIR+CARE Validation Logs**
`data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/validation/faircare/README.md`

**Purpose:** Repository for FAIR+CARE audit, ethics validation, and governance synchronization reports related to hazard data pipelines in the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
This workspace ensures that all hazard datasets undergo continuous compliance verification for *Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, Reusability* (FAIR) and *Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, Ethics* (CARE) standards.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/validation/faircare/` directory stores **FAIR+CARE compliance validation reports and governance audit logs** produced during hazard data ETL, validation, and publication workflows.  
These files ensure KFM datasets uphold ethical data stewardship, accessibility, and provenance standards defined under FAIR+CARE governance.

### Core Functions:
- Validate hazard datasets against FAIR+CARE metrics.  
- Record ethics and accessibility audits for every ETL and AI cycle.  
- Synchronize validation results with the governance and provenance ledgers.  
- Provide evidence of compliance for audits, publications, and certifications.  

All records here are checksum-verified, timestamped, and certified under FAIR+CARE governance protocols.

    C --> D["Governance Synchronization and Certification"]
    D --> E["Publication and Provenance Registration"]
```

### Workflow Description:
1. **Input Validation:** Audits use validated hazard data outputs as input.  
2. **FAIR+CARE Audit:** Compliance assessed using automated FAIR+CARE scoring framework.  
3. **Governance Logging:** Results stored in the provenance ledger for transparency.  
4. **Certification:** FAIR+CARE Council reviews and certifies compliance.  
5. **Publication:** Reports shared with governance and ethics documentation systems.

## üß† FAIR+CARE Governance Summary

| Principle | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Findable** | All validated datasets linked with persistent identifiers and metadata. |
| **Accessible** | Hazard data released under open-access, non-restrictive terms. |
| **Interoperable** | Data aligned with STAC/DCAT FAIR schema. |
| **Reusable** | Provenance and checksum records ensure reproducibility. |
| **Collective Benefit** | Enables equitable data use for hazard resilience research. |
| **Authority to Control** | FAIR+CARE Council oversees ethics validation and certification. |
| **Responsibility** | Validation teams ensure transparency and data quality assurance. |
| **Ethics** | Verifies all datasets meet ethical data-sharing standards. |

Audit and governance outcomes registered in:  
`data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json` and  
`data/reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json`.
