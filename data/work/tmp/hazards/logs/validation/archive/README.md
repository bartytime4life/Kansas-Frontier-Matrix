# üóÇÔ∏è Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Hazard Validation Archive**
`data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/validation/archive/README.md`

**Purpose:** Long-term archival workspace for completed hazard validation reports, FAIR+CARE ethics certifications, and governance logs within the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
This directory preserves historical validation data and provenance metadata to ensure reproducibility, transparency, and ethical accountability under FAIR+CARE governance.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/validation/archive/` directory contains **archived validation logs and FAIR+CARE certifications** for all hazard datasets that have passed final governance review.  
These records serve as immutable validation artifacts ensuring data quality, compliance, and ethical certification continuity across project releases.

### Core Functions:
- Preserve validation results and FAIR+CARE certifications from completed data cycles.  
- Maintain historical governance audit and ethics compliance records.  
- Provide lineage linkage for long-term reproducibility and FAIR+CARE traceability.  
- Support retrospective validation reviews and re-certification audits.  

All archived validation files are checksum-verified, digitally signed, and linked to the **KFM Provenance Ledger**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Validation Archival Workflow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Completed Validation Logs (data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/validation/)"] --> B["Checksum Verification and Metadata Registration"]
    B --> C["FAIR+CARE Certification and Governance Sign-Off"]
    C --> D["Archival Transfer (data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/validation/archive/)"]
    D --> E["Provenance Ledger Synchronization"]
```

### Workflow Description:
1. **Validation Completion:** Datasets pass schema and ethics verification in the active validation directory.  
2. **Checksum Registration:** File integrity verified and checksums stored in manifest registry.  
3. **Governance Certification:** FAIR+CARE Council approves ethics and compliance reports.  
4. **Archival Transfer:** Certified files moved to `archive/` for permanent storage.  
5. **Ledger Update:** Provenance ledger updated to link validation event lineage.

## üß† FAIR+CARE Governance Alignment

| Principle | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Findable** | Archived validation logs indexed by ETL cycle, dataset, and certification type. |
| **Accessible** | Stored in open formats (JSON, CSV, text) under controlled internal access. |
| **Interoperable** | Aligned with FAIR+CARE metadata and governance schemas. |
| **Reusable** | Contains lineage, schema references, and checksum validation. |
| **Collective Benefit** | Promotes transparency, reproducibility, and ethical stewardship. |
| **Authority to Control** | FAIR+CARE Council maintains archival certification oversight. |
| **Responsibility** | Validation and governance teams ensure accurate certification logging. |
| **Ethics** | Retains verified FAIR+CARE compliance metadata to ensure accountability. |

All audit results referenced in:  
`data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json`  
and `data/reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json`.
