# üßæ Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Current Hazard Manifests**
`data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/manifests/current/README.md`

**Purpose:** Active workspace for current hazard dataset manifests and checksum registries generated during ongoing ETL, validation, and governance workflows in the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
These manifests ensure real-time lineage tracking, reproducibility, and FAIR+CARE compliance for hazard data pipelines before archival and certification.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/manifests/current/` directory stores **active dataset manifests and governance-linked checksum registries** produced during hazard ETL and AI workflows.  
These manifests document the latest state of hazard datasets prior to their transfer into archival repositories.

### Core Functions:
- Maintain current manifests for active hazard datasets and transformations.  
- Record schema linkage, dataset version metadata, and governance verification results.  
- Enable real-time reproducibility and validation before FAIR+CARE archival.  
- Provide provenance assurance for ongoing ETL and AI hazard analytics workflows.  

All manifest files are updated automatically through ETL pipelines and linked to the KFM **Provenance Ledger** for audit integrity.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Manifest Generation Workflow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Hazard ETL Output (data/work/staging/hazards/)"] --> B["Generate Current Manifest (checksums, metadata, lineage)"]
    B --> C["FAIR and CARE Validation"]
    C --> D["Governance Synchronization (Active Ledger Updates)"]
    D --> E["Prepare for Archival Transition"]
```

### Workflow Description:
1. **Manifest Compilation:** Aggregate dataset file listings, schema references, and version metadata.  
2. **Validation:** Perform checksum verification and FAIR+CARE ethical audits.  
3. **Governance Sync:** Register current manifest events in governance ledger for transparency.  
4. **Stabilization:** Maintain manifest as the authoritative reference until next certification cycle.  
5. **Archival Prep:** Transition manifests to `data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/manifests/archive/` after cycle closure.

## üß† FAIR+CARE Governance Alignment

| Principle | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Findable** | Current manifests indexed by dataset version and ETL cycle. |
| **Accessible** | Stored in open formats (JSON, CSV, log) for internal governance. |
| **Interoperable** | Conforms to DCAT, STAC, and KFM metadata standards. |
| **Reusable** | Includes schema, provenance, and checksum lineage metadata. |
| **Collective Benefit** | Enables transparent, real-time monitoring of hazard data readiness. |
| **Authority to Control** | FAIR+CARE Council reviews current manifest state before archival. |
| **Responsibility** | ETL maintainers ensure validation accuracy and reproducibility. |
| **Ethics** | Ensures open, equitable access and compliance with FAIR+CARE data ethics. |

Governance results referenced in:  
`data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json`  
and `data/reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Manifest Artifacts

| File | Description | Format |
|------|--------------|--------|
| `hazard_manifest_current_*.json` | Manifest defining current dataset composition and schema. | JSON |
| `checksum_registry_current_*.csv` | File-level hash and integrity registry. | CSV |
| `governance_registration_current.log` | Real-time governance sync events. | Text |
| `faircare_manifest_validation.json` | FAIR+CARE ethics audit for ongoing data operations. | JSON |
| `metadata.json` | Tracks provenance, checksum validation, and governance linkage. | JSON |

All manifest updates automated via `manifest_current_sync.yml`.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Governance & Provenance Integration

| Record | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `metadata.json` | Captures governance linkage, checksum registry, and manifest lineage. |
| `data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json` | Logs ongoing manifest updates and ethics review events. |
| `data/reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json` | FAIR+CARE audit metrics and governance validation outcomes. |
| `releases/v9.3.2/manifest.zip` | Includes verified manifest files for current release cycle. |

Governance synchronization occurs automatically via CI/CD pipelines during ETL operations.

---

## üßæ Retention & Version Policy

| Manifest Type | Retention Duration | Policy |
|----------------|--------------------|--------|
| Current Manifests | Active cycle only | Replaced after archival registration. |
| FAIR+CARE Reports | 90 days | Archived to manifest archive after certification. |
| Governance Logs | 90 days | Retained until next synchronization cycle. |
| Metadata | Permanent | Maintained for lineage and provenance continuity. |

Retention governed by `manifest_current_cleanup.yml`.
