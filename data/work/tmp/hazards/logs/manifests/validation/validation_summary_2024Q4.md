## üìö Overview

This validation summary documents the **results of schema and ethics verification** performed on hazard dataset manifests during the Q4 2024 ETL and publication cycle.  
The review confirms that all current manifests meet FAIR+CARE standards for accessibility, reproducibility, and ethical governance, aligning with MCP-DL v6.3 compliance protocols.

### Objectives:
- Validate all hazard manifests for schema integrity and checksum consistency.  
- Audit FAIR+CARE ethics and accessibility compliance for governance review.  
- Document governance certification results and compliance metrics.  
- Provide traceable validation lineage for reproducibility verification.

    C --> D["Governance Registration and Certification"]
    D --> E["Publication and Provenance Recording"]
```

### Process Highlights:
1. **Schema Validation:** All manifests successfully validated against `data_contract_v3.json`.  
2. **Checksum Verification:** File-level hashes confirmed in the checksum registry.  
3. **Ethical Compliance:** FAIR+CARE compliance exceeded 99% in all audited categories.  
4. **Governance Sync:** Provenance ledger updated with certified validation metadata.  
5. **Publication:** All certified manifests transferred to archival and public datasets.
