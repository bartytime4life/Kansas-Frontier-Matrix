# üìë Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Hazard Manifest Reports**
`data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/manifests/reports/README.md`

**Purpose:** Repository for manifest audit reports, FAIR+CARE certification summaries, and governance validation records related to hazard data manifests within the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
These reports consolidate metadata lineage, checksum integrity, and ethical governance assessments for each certified hazard dataset version.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/manifests/reports/` directory stores **manifest-level audit and certification reports** for all hazard datasets processed within KFM.  
These files summarize validation results, checksum audits, and FAIR+CARE ethics compliance, linking all governance records across the hazard data lifecycle.

### Core Functions:
- Consolidate validation results from current and archived manifests.  
- Record checksum verification and schema consistency audits.  
- Provide FAIR+CARE certification results for hazard data collections.  
- Maintain lineage across versions for reproducibility and governance integrity.  

All manifest reports are checksum-verified, FAIR+CARE-certified, and permanently logged in the **KFM Governance Ledger**.

    A["Current & Archived Manifests (data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/manifests/*)"] --> B["Checksum and Schema Validation"]
    B --> C["FAIR+CARE Ethics Certification"]
    C --> D["Governance Review and Audit Report Generation"]
    D --> E["Provenance Ledger Registration"]
```

### Workflow Description:
1. **Audit Input:** Gather manifests from current and archive directories for analysis.  
2. **Checksum Verification:** Validate file integrity across versions.  
3. **FAIR+CARE Certification:** Perform ethical, reproducible compliance audit.  
4. **Governance Review:** Generate certification summary and compliance dashboard.  
5. **Registration:** Log certification event in provenance ledger for full traceability.

## üß† FAIR+CARE Governance Alignment

| Principle | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Findable** | Manifest reports indexed by ETL cycle, dataset, and governance ID. |
| **Accessible** | Reports stored in open JSON, CSV, and Markdown formats. |
| **Interoperable** | Aligned with DCAT and FAIR+CARE governance schemas. |
| **Reusable** | Includes metadata, lineage, and audit provenance for reproducibility. |
| **Collective Benefit** | Promotes transparent data validation and open science practices. |
| **Authority to Control** | FAIR+CARE Council validates all certification reports. |
| **Responsibility** | Data governance team maintains certification logs and provenance records. |
| **Ethics** | Ensures transparency and ethical documentation across all data lifecycle phases. |

All governance references maintained in:  
`data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json` and  
`data/reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json`.
