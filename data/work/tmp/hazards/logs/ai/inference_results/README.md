# üìà Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **AI Inference Results**
`data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/ai/inference_results/README.md`

**Purpose:** Repository for AI inference outputs and prediction logs generated by hazard risk models in the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
This layer tracks model predictions, spatial probabilities, and governance-linked evaluation metrics for FAIR+CARE-compliant hazard forecasting.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/ai/inference_results/` directory contains **AI inference output artifacts** for hazard prediction models.  
Each file records model results, spatial risk estimates, and uncertainty scores generated by machine learning pipelines.  
All outputs are monitored, validated, and logged under FAIR+CARE and AI ethics frameworks for accountability and reproducibility.

### Core Functions:
- Store AI hazard predictions for floods, tornadoes, droughts, and other natural risks.  
- Log model confidence, spatial coverage, and ethics metrics for FAIR+CARE validation.  
- Provide traceable inference records for governance ledger synchronization.  
- Support retraining, performance monitoring, and transparency dashboards.  

All inference results in this directory are temporary and automatically promoted or archived after verification.

    B --> C["Validate Inference Outputs for FAIR+CARE Compliance"]
    C --> D["Store Inference Results (data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/ai/inference_results/)"]
    D --> E["Governance Ledger Sync and Dashboard Publication"]
```

### Workflow Description:
1. **Model Execution:** AI models generate hazard predictions using current environmental data.  
2. **Result Validation:** Inference outputs reviewed for schema compliance and ethical fairness.  
3. **Metadata Recording:** Model version, run ID, and performance logs captured in governance metadata.  
4. **Governance Sync:** Inference metadata and predictions registered in AI governance ledger.  
5. **Dashboard Integration:** Outputs linked to Focus Mode visualization layers for interpretability.

## üß† FAIR+CARE AI Governance Summary

| Principle | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Findable** | Each inference record logged with model version, checksum, and run ID. |
| **Accessible** | Stored in open CSV, JSON, and GeoJSON formats for transparency. |
| **Interoperable** | Compatible with KFM schemas, AI dashboards, and STAC/DCAT catalogs. |
| **Reusable** | Contains lineage, checksum, and validation reports for reproducibility. |
| **Collective Benefit** | Supports transparent, equitable AI use in hazard forecasting. |
| **Authority to Control** | FAIR+CARE Council and AI Governance Board review inference outputs. |
| **Responsibility** | Validators ensure predictions meet performance and ethics standards. |
| **Ethics** | Bias and model drift reviewed to prevent unethical or misleading outcomes. |

All audit and governance logs registered in:  
`data/reports/audit/ai_hazards_ledger.json` and  
`data/reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Inference Metrics and QA Checks

| Metric | Description | Threshold |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| **F1 Score** | Measures model prediction accuracy. | ‚â• 0.90 for production models |
| **Mean Confidence** | Average model confidence across predictions. | ‚â• 0.85 |
| **Calibration Error** | Evaluates model probability reliability. | ‚â§ 0.05 |
| **Bias Index** | Detects fairness issues in geographic predictions. | ‚â§ 0.1 |
