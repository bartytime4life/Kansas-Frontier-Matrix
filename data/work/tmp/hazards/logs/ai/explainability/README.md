# üß† Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **AI Explainability Reports**
`data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/ai/explainability/README.md`

**Purpose:** Repository for AI model explainability artifacts, feature importance analyses, and ethics validation reports generated during hazard model inference in the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
This workspace documents *why* AI models make predictions‚Äîensuring interpretability, fairness, and compliance under FAIR+CARE and AI governance protocols.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/ai/explainability/` directory captures **AI model interpretability and transparency artifacts** for hazard-focused machine learning systems within KFM.  
These reports quantify feature contributions, local and global explanations, and ethical model reasoning diagnostics aligned with FAIR+CARE‚Äôs *Explainability & Accountability* principles.

### Core Functions:
- Document model interpretability using SHAP, LIME, and attention-weight analyses.  
- Visualize feature importance distributions across hazard events (e.g., floods, tornadoes).  
- Record local explanation summaries for Focus Mode hazard queries.  
- Provide governance-traceable explainability and ethics validation reports.  

All explainability data is reviewed by the FAIR+CARE Council and AI Governance Board to ensure ethical transparency.

## ‚öôÔ∏è AI Explainability Workflow

    A["AI Model Inference (Focus Mode)"] --> B["Feature Attribution (SHAP / LIME / Attention)"]
    B --> C["Explainability Report Generation (data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/ai/explainability/)"]
    C --> D["FAIR+CARE Ethical Review"]
    D --> E["Governance Ledger Synchronization"]
    E --> F["Publication to Focus Mode Dashboard / Model Registry"]
```

### Workflow Description:
1. **Model Execution:** AI hazard models (e.g., flood-risk predictors) perform inference and log outputs.  
2. **Attribution Analysis:** SHAP and LIME generate global and local feature attributions.  
3. **Explainability Generation:** Reports summarize interpretability metrics, highlighting key input drivers.  
4. **Ethics Review:** FAIR+CARE auditors verify model transparency and human-comprehensible results.  
5. **Governance Sync:** Reports registered within `data/reports/audit/ai_hazards_ledger.json` for reproducibility.
