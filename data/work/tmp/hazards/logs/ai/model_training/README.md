# üß© Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **AI Model Training Logs**
`data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/ai/model_training/README.md`

**Purpose:** Repository for machine learning model training artifacts, metrics, and governance-linked validation reports used in hazard forecasting pipelines within the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
This workspace provides transparent documentation of training runs, hyperparameter configurations, FAIR+CARE ethical checks, and lineage certification for all AI models.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/ai/model_training/` directory stores **AI model training logs, metadata, and validation reports** produced by hazard analytics pipelines.  
All training sessions are version-controlled, FAIR+CARE audited, and registered in KFM‚Äôs AI Governance Ledger for transparency and reproducibility.

### Core Functions:
- Record hyperparameter configurations and training environment metadata.  
- Track model performance metrics, bias detection, and ethical compliance.  
- Generate explainability-ready model snapshots for governance review.  
- Maintain lineage between raw training data, model checkpoints, and validation runs.  

Every model trained within this workspace passes through automatic validation and ethical review before deployment.

```

### Workflow Description:
1. **Configuration:** Define hyperparameters, model architecture, and random seeds.  
2. **Training Execution:** Run model training sessions with real-time metric logging.  
3. **Validation:** Generate evaluation metrics and verify schema integrity.  
4. **FAIR+CARE Audit:** Conduct bias and fairness assessments for ethical compliance.  
5. **Governance Sync:** Register model details and checksums in `data/reports/audit/ai_hazards_ledger.json`.
