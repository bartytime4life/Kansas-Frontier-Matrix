# 🤖 Kansas Frontier Matrix — **Hazard AI Logs**
`data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/ai/README.md`

**Purpose:**  
FAIR+CARE-certified logging workspace for AI explainability, Focus Mode reasoning, drift detection, and ethics auditing in the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM) hazards module.  
This directory maintains transparent, reproducible AI model performance and bias analysis for meteorological, hydrological, geological, and wildfire/energy hazard intelligence.

## 📚 Overview

The **Hazard AI Logs** directory records explainability audits, bias detections, and performance metrics generated by Focus Mode AI models used in hazard analysis.  
It ensures every AI decision, correlation, and forecast event remains interpretable, ethically verified, and governance-logged.

### Core Responsibilities
- Log model runs, inference cycles, and reasoning outputs.  
- Capture AI bias, drift, and ethics compliance audits.  
- Document model explainability (SHAP, LIME, and FAIR metrics).  
- Integrate performance telemetry with KFM’s governance and provenance ledgers.

    C --> D["Governance Logging and Telemetry Synchronization"]
    D --> E["Provenance Ledger Registration (Immutable Record)"]
```

### Description
1. **Explainability:** Analyze model decision weights and feature impacts.  
2. **Drift Detection:** Identify shifts in input distribution or bias patterns.  
3. **Ethics Review:** Conduct FAIR+CARE audit for algorithmic equity.  
4. **Governance Logging:** Sync explainability metrics with provenance records.  
5. **Telemetry Integration:** Log resource use, latency, and validation metadata.
