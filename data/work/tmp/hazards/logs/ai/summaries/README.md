# üßæ Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **AI Summary Reports**
`data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/ai/summaries/README.md`

**Purpose:** Centralized repository for AI performance summaries, ethics validation digests, and model governance dashboards within the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
This directory consolidates metadata and audit insights from all AI processes (training, inference, explainability, and drift) to provide FAIR+CARE-aligned overviews of hazard model health and accountability.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/ai/summaries/` directory serves as a **FAIR+CARE-aligned consolidation point** for all AI model audit summaries and ethical compliance dashboards within KFM.  
It provides interpretable, multi-domain snapshots of model behavior, validation scores, and governance status across all hazard-focused AI systems.

### Core Functions:
- Summarize AI performance metrics (F1, recall, precision, drift, bias, fairness).  
- Aggregate ethical compliance scores for governance board review.  
- Record summary metadata for inclusion in FAIR+CARE dashboards.  
- Provide governance-ready reports linking model health and transparency documentation.  

All summaries are ephemeral but synchronized with permanent governance ledgers for long-term traceability.

## ‚öôÔ∏è AI Summary Generation Workflow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["AI Logs (Training / Inference / Explainability / Drift)"] --> B["FAIR and CARE Audit Aggregation"]
    B --> C["Model Health Summary Compilation (data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/ai/summaries/)"]
    C --> D["Governance Dashboard Snapshot"]
    D --> E["Ledger Registration and FAIR+CARE Review"]
```

### Workflow Description:
1. **Data Ingestion:** Pulls audit logs from AI subdirectories (training, inference, drift, explainability).  
2. **Aggregation:** Compiles performance metrics, validation scores, and bias indicators.  
3. **Ethical Review:** Aggregates FAIR+CARE ethics ratings from all AI processes.  
4. **Reporting:** Generates governance summaries for council review and documentation.  
5. **Ledger Sync:** Registers results in `data/reports/audit/ai_hazards_ledger.json` for audit integrity.

## üß† FAIR+CARE Governance Summary

| Principle | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Findable** | Summaries cataloged by audit cycle and model identifier. |
| **Accessible** | Stored in open JSON and CSV formats for governance visualization. |
| **Interoperable** | Linked to training, inference, drift, and explainability reports. |
| **Reusable** | Used by governance dashboards and annual FAIR+CARE audit reviews. |
| **Collective Benefit** | Enables ethical transparency across all AI hazard systems. |
| **Authority to Control** | FAIR+CARE Council validates all summary certifications. |
| **Responsibility** | Model maintainers ensure all logs contribute to reproducible summaries. |
| **Ethics** | Summaries emphasize human oversight and fairness in AI governance. |

All FAIR+CARE and governance results aggregated in:  
`data/reports/audit/ai_hazards_ledger.json`  
and `data/reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json`.
