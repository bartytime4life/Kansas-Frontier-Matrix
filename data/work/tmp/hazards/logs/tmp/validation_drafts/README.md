# üßæ Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Hazard Validation Draft Logs**
`data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/tmp/validation_drafts/README.md`

**Purpose:** Temporary workspace for draft validation results, QA summaries, and FAIR+CARE audit pre-reviews generated during hazard dataset testing in the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
This directory functions as a holding zone for incomplete or in-review validation documents before their promotion to certified governance records.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/tmp/validation_drafts/` directory stores **in-progress validation reports and pre-audit documentation** produced during the hazard data pipeline testing phase.  
These drafts are used for internal review, iterative schema corrections, and ethics evaluation before FAIR+CARE Council approval.

### Core Functions:
- Hold validation drafts for schema, ethics, and QA audits under review.  
- Support collaborative FAIR+CARE Council and engineering review cycles.  
- Serve as staging for internal testing and error correction before certification.  
- Maintain reproducibility and transparency through early metadata registration.  

All draft reports are automatically versioned and purged or promoted upon governance approval.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Validation Draft Workflow

    A["Validation In Progress (Schema + FAIR+CARE)"] --> B["Draft Reports Generated (validation_drafts/)"]
    B --> C["Internal Review and Quality Assurance"]
    C --> D["Governance Pre-Certification Audit"]
    D --> E["Promotion to Certified Validation Logs or Purge"]
```

### Workflow Description:
1. **Initial Validation:** ETL and AI pipelines produce draft reports during data testing.  
2. **Internal QA Review:** Drafts undergo technical and ethical checks by maintainers.  
3. **Pre-Audit Governance:** FAIR+CARE Council reviews draft compliance for accuracy.  
4. **Approval or Revision:** Drafts either approved for certification or flagged for rework.  
5. **Archival / Cleanup:** Non-compliant drafts removed after 30 days.

## üß† FAIR+CARE Governance Alignment

| Principle | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Findable** | Draft reports indexed by ETL cycle and dataset ID for traceability. |
| **Accessible** | Stored in open formats (JSON, CSV, Markdown) for Council review. |
| **Interoperable** | Structured according to FAIR+CARE validation schema. |
| **Reusable** | Maintains metadata and lineage records for reproducibility. |
| **Collective Benefit** | Enables collaborative audit and continuous improvement cycles. |
| **Authority to Control** | FAIR+CARE Council provides oversight on validation approvals. |
| **Responsibility** | Validators document corrections and ethical considerations. |
| **Ethics** | Ensures no uncertified data proceeds without transparent review. |

Governance linkage maintained in:  
`data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json`  
and `data/reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json`.
