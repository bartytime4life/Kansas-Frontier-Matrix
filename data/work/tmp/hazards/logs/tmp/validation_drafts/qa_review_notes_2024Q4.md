## 🧠 Overview

This document records the **internal quality assurance review cycle** for hazard dataset validation drafts evaluated during Q4 2024.  
It focuses on schema completeness, ethics verification, FAIR+CARE alignment, and governance traceability prior to final certification.

### Objectives:
- Summarize QA findings from validation drafts under internal FAIR+CARE review.  
- Identify data quality, schema, or ethical discrepancies requiring revision.  
- Provide governance recommendations for next-cycle improvements.  
- Prepare drafts for promotion to final certified validation logs.

## ⚙️ Draft Reports Reviewed

| Draft Report | Review Status | FAIR+CARE Status | Notes |
|---------------|----------------|------------------|-------|
| `validation_draft_report_2024Q4.json` | ✅ Reviewed | 🟡 Pending Certification | Schema alignment complete; metadata fields require clarification. |
| `faircare_pre_audit_draft_2024Q4.json` | ✅ Reviewed | 🟢 Compliant | No ethical concerns; minor accessibility recommendations. |
| `validation_errors_summary_2024Q4.csv` | ✅ Reviewed | 🟡 Partial | 3 unresolved QA warnings related to null geospatial attributes. |

## 🔍 QA Findings Summary

| Category | Finding | Severity | Action Required |
|-----------|----------|-----------|----------------|
| **Schema Compliance** | Missing `license` field in 2 manifests. | ⚠️ Moderate | Update metadata contract before final validation. |
| **Checksum Validation** | All dataset hashes verified successfully. | ✅ Pass | None. |
| **FAIR+CARE Review** | Ethics audit compliance at 99.3%; accessibility testing pending. | 🟢 Low | Complete accessibility validation by 2025-01-05. |
| **Metadata Completeness** | 2 metadata items missing `provenance_ref`. | ⚠️ Moderate | Add provenance references per KFM contract v3. |
| **Geospatial Integrity** | 3 datasets missing bounding box precision in STAC fields. | ⚠️ Moderate | Regenerate manifest metadata for affected datasets. |

---

## ⚖️ Governance Recommendations

1. ✅ Approve all FAIR+CARE pre-audits pending minor metadata corrections.  
2. 🔹 Conduct accessibility test (FAIR Principle A) before certification finalization.  
3. 🔹 Integrate automated field consistency check for provenance fields in next ETL cycle.  
4. 🔹 Implement checksum delta monitoring via `manifest_diff_sync.yml` for better change tracking.  
5. 🔹 Schedule ethics re-audit before Q1 2025 release to maintain Platinum FAIR+CARE status.
