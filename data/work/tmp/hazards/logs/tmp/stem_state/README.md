# üåê Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Hazard STEM State Logs**
`data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/tmp/stem_state/README.md`

**Purpose:** Temporary workspace for recording the real-time *STEM State* of hazard pipelines‚Äîrepresenting active computational, scientific, and governance status snapshots across ETL, AI, and FAIR+CARE processes in the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
This directory maintains transient monitoring files that reflect the dynamic operational condition of hazard data and model systems.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/tmp/stem_state/` directory captures **transient STEM state logs** that monitor the live computational, ethical, and environmental status of ongoing hazard data operations.  
It functions as a real-time observability and reproducibility checkpoint for FAIR+CARE-aligned data workflows, including ETL, AI inference, validation, and governance synchronization.

### Core Functions:
- Monitor the operational state of active ETL and AI workflows.  
- Record system resource utilization and model computation diagnostics.  
- Capture FAIR+CARE live compliance metrics for audit visibility.  
- Facilitate reproducibility through temporal state preservation snapshots.  

All STEM State logs are temporary and automatically cleared or archived post-processing once governance synchronization is complete.

    B --> C["Generate STEM State Snapshots"]
    C --> D["Governance Queue (Awaiting Ethics Review)"]
    D --> E["Archival / Cleanup (Post-Certification)"]
```

### Workflow Description:
1. **Real-Time Capture:** Logs the operational status of ETL, validation, and AI systems.  
2. **Resource Metrics:** Monitors CPU, GPU, and memory consumption for reproducibility audits.  
3. **Ethical Tracking:** Captures FAIR+CARE compliance conditions in real time.  
4. **Governance Review:** Exports results to `data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/tmp/governance_queue/` for ethics certification.  
5. **Cleanup:** Purged after workflow completion and governance ledger update.

## üß† FAIR+CARE Governance Alignment

| Principle | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Findable** | STEM state logs indexed by timestamp and pipeline stage. |
| **Accessible** | Stored in open JSON and text formats for reproducibility analysis. |
| **Interoperable** | Schema aligned with KFM‚Äôs FAIR+CARE telemetry schema. |
| **Reusable** | Records operational context and ethics compliance data. |
| **Collective Benefit** | Ensures open observability for computational integrity. |
| **Authority to Control** | FAIR+CARE Council oversees ethics compliance for live data operations. |
| **Responsibility** | Engineers and AI teams maintain performance transparency. |
| **Ethics** | Guarantees ethical computing resource use and data processing accountability. |

Governance linkage maintained in:  
`data/reports/audit/system_runtime_ledger.json`  
and `data/reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json`.
