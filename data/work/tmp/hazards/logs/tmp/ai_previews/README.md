# üß† Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Hazard AI Previews**
`data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/tmp/ai_previews/README.md`

**Purpose:** Temporary workspace for preview outputs, model inferences, and explainability summaries produced by hazard-focused AI models within the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
This directory captures early-stage results from AI/ML hazard simulations, enabling FAIR+CARE-governed analysis, validation, and governance review before publication or archival.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/tmp/ai_previews/` directory holds **temporary AI preview artifacts** ‚Äî including predictions, visualizations, explainability insights, and model summaries.  
These files provide early visibility into model behavior, performance, and ethics alignment before FAIR+CARE-certified release into the permanent governance framework.

### Core Functions:
- Capture preliminary AI outputs for hazard models during inference and retraining.  
- Generate explainability previews (e.g., SHAP, LIME, attention maps).  
- Facilitate FAIR+CARE pre-validation for ethical AI readiness.  
- Support governance review and model calibration prior to final certification.  

All preview results are temporary, automatically purged or promoted to validation workflows after review by KFM‚Äôs AI Governance Board.

## ‚öôÔ∏è AI Preview Workflow

    A["AI Model Inference (Hazard Simulation)"] --> B["Generate Predictions (Preview Mode)"]
    B --> C["Explainability and Bias Pre-Validation"]
    C --> D["Review and FAIR+CARE Audit (Governance Queue)"]
    D --> E["Promotion or Cleanup (Validation / Retention Policy)"]
```

### Workflow Description:
1. **Inference Execution:** Hazard models generate preview outputs for analysis and review.  
2. **Explainability Check:** SHAP, LIME, or integrated attention maps visualize key prediction drivers.  
3. **Bias Pre-Audit:** Assess fairness and ethical alignment using preliminary data metrics.  
4. **Governance Review:** FAIR+CARE Council evaluates preview results before certification.  
5. **Retention Handling:** Files either archived to validation layers or purged post-review.

## üß† FAIR+CARE Governance Alignment

| Principle | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Findable** | Previews indexed by model ID, date, and validation cycle. |
| **Accessible** | Stored in open JSON and image formats for ethics and QA review. |
| **Interoperable** | Aligned with FAIR+CARE AI audit schema and DCAT conventions. |
| **Reusable** | Metadata includes lineage, model version, and governance traceability. |
| **Collective Benefit** | Supports ethical hazard forecasting and public safety innovation. |
| **Authority to Control** | FAIR+CARE Council oversees model preview and approval cycles. |
| **Responsibility** | AI engineers validate interpretability and ethical safeguards. |
| **Ethics** | Ensures transparency, bias mitigation, and equitable decision outputs. |

FAIR+CARE audits stored in:  
`data/reports/audit/ai_hazards_ledger.json`  
and `data/reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json`.
