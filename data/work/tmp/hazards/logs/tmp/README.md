# 🧪 Kansas Frontier Matrix — **Hazards TMP Logs**  
`data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/tmp/`

**Mission:** Manage ephemeral and debug-level logs for hazard ETL operations — ensuring safe cleanup, checksum verification, and compliance with governance retention policies.

## 🧭 Overview

The **TMP Logs Layer** provides controlled ephemeral space for pipeline diagnostics and temporary runtime artifacts.  
All temporary data here is **non-persistent**, **checksum-verified**, and **subject to auto-clean rules** managed by CI workflows and governance retention schedules.

**Scope:**
- Stores ETL and AI debug logs during active sessions  
- Auto-purges old temporary logs post-validation cycle  
- Maintains checksums for integrity prior to deletion  
- Validates cleanup actions against ledger and FAIR+CARE policies  

> *“Even temporary data deserves an honest record.”*
