## üìö Overview
This directory stores **temporary log artifacts** generated by hazard data processing, AI explainability, and system monitoring pipelines.  
Each subdirectory corresponds to a distinct log domain (ETL, AI drift, FAIR validation, energy analysis, archival I/O) used for internal monitoring before final export into the permanent STAC catalog and blockchain-linked governance ledger.  

These logs enable **deterministic reproducibility** of hazard analyses by tracking every intermediate transformation, AI decision, and validation cycle executed in the hazard workflow. They are ephemeral but fully auditable, bridging the raw-to-validated data states within the **Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM) Hazard System**.

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ai/                 # AI explainability, drift detection, and confidence scoring logs  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ archive/            # Temporary signed archives before checksum sealing

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ validation/         # Internal schema checks and validation reports  

All log directories are automatically rotated based on retention policy and sealed via checksum manifest generation. On each cycle, temporary logs are summarized, exported, and purged through CI/CD-controlled retention workflows.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow Integration
### Hazard Data Lifecycle
Hazards ETL Logs ‚Üí Focus Mode AI (Explainability + Drift Detection) ‚Üí FAIR+CARE Council ‚Üí Ethics Board ‚Üí Governance Ledger + Blockchain ‚Üí Oversight Council ‚Üí Neo4j Knowledge Graph Integration ‚Üí AI Retraining + Model Drift Reduction ‚Üí Hazards ETL Logs  

- **ETL Logs:** Capture ingestion and normalization of hazard datasets (NOAA Storm Events, FEMA Disaster Declarations, USGS Floods, NWS Tornado Tracks).  
- **AI Logs:** Record model outputs, drift deltas, and explainability metrics (feature importance, SHAP variance).  
- **FAIR+CARE Logs:** Track metadata conformance and ethical compliance of hazard predictions (e.g., equity checks for regional disaster impact).  
- **System Logs:** Monitor runtime performance and error recovery events.  
- **Energy Logs:** Record cascading infrastructure hazard events (grid failures, outages, pipeline disruptions).  

All logs converge into the governance ledger, producing FAIR-aligned, cryptographically verified audit trails (`reports/audit/ai_hazards_ledger.json`).

---

## üß≠ Focus Mode Integration
When a user enters **AI-Powered Focus Mode**, the hazard telemetry stored here provides real-time contextual inputs to the knowledge graph and Focus dashboard.  

**Functions:**  
- Drift correlation between multi-source hazard datasets (e.g., NOAA vs. USGS hydrology).  
- Semantic cross-matching (e.g., tornado severity vs. infrastructure damage).  
- Temporal anomaly detection (e.g., model bias drift across years).  
- Confidence scoring for Focus Mode AI summaries in `releases/v9.3.2/focus-telemetry.json`.  

These logs underpin the explainable AI layer of Focus Mode, ensuring transparency in hazard predictions and historical trend detection.

## üîí Data Retention & Compliance
| Type | Retention Period | Format | Destination | Encryption |  
|------|------------------|---------|--------------|-------------|  
| ETL Logs | 72 hours | NDJSON | data/work/staging/logs/etl/ | AES-256 at rest |  
| AI Logs | 48 hours | JSON-LD | data/work/staging/logs/ai/ | AES-256 at rest |  
| FAIRCARE Logs | 48 hours | YAML | data/work/staging/logs/faircare/ | SHA-512 signatures |  
| System Logs | 24 hours | TXT/JSON | data/work/staging/logs/system/ | Encrypted in transit |  
| Manifest Temp | 12 hours | ZIP/YAML | data/checksums/manifests/ | GPG-signed |  

Automated retention policies are enforced via GitHub Actions and validated by `make logs-validate`.  
Every log archive is sealed with checksum, timestamp, and cryptographic provenance tokens for governance chain integrity.

---

## üß™ Validation & FAIR+CARE Alignment
- **FAIR:** Each log entry includes persistent identifiers, metadata linkage, and schema compliance (STAC + JSON Schema).  
- **CARE:** Bias evaluation reports ensure ethical balance in AI hazard classification (regional, temporal, socio-economic).  
- **Validation:** Schema enforcement via `schemas/telemetry/work-hazards-tmp-v14.json`.  
- **Crosschecks:** Log records validated against hazard ontology (`docs/ontology/hazards.ttl`) and AI behavior metrics (`docs/ai/drift-metrics.md`).  
- **Checksum Audit:** Every archived log‚Äôs SHA-256 recorded in `reports/system/integrity/hazards_pipeline_checks.json`.  

---

## üìà Governance & Audit Chain
All hazard TMP logs merge into immutable blockchain-ledger manifests to ensure:  
1. **Provenance Traceability:** Each log ‚Üí manifest ‚Üí STAC entry ‚Üí governance ledger.  
2. **Semantic Versioning:** Logs reference the ontology and FAIR+CARE status metadata.  
3. **Reproducibility:** Any analyst can replay the ETL cycle and compare validation deltas.  
4. **Accountability:** Audit trails feed to the AI Ethics Board for compliance and model retraining oversight.  
5. **Security:** Manifests signed by CI/CD identity keys under `docs/standards/security.md`.  

This pipeline upholds the KFM mission of open, auditable, and ethical AI-backed scientific data management.
