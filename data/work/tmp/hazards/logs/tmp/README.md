# ‚ö†Ô∏è **Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî Hazards TMP Logs**  
`data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/tmp/README.md`

**Purpose:** Temporary workspace for intermediate AI, ETL, and system logs related to hazard datasets ‚Äî flood, tornado, drought, wildfire ‚Äî before archival and FAIR validation.

## üìö Overview

This directory stores **temporary log artifacts** generated by hazard data processing and AI explainability pipelines.  
Each subdirectory corresponds to a distinct log domain (ETL, AI drift, FAIR validation, archival I/O) used for internal monitoring before final export into the permanent STAC catalog or governance ledger.

These logs help trace each transformation, data normalization, and AI reasoning process applied to hazard-related data sources ‚Äî enabling reproducibility, error detection, and versioned auditing.

```bash
data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/tmp/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ai/                 # AI explainability and drift detection logs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ archive/            # Temporary archives before checksum signing

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tmp/                # Volatile process output (auto-cleaned daily)

Each folder maintains structured JSON or NDJSON logs.
They are cleared or archived automatically on each successful ETL cycle (make data or make hazards-sync).

%% END OF MERMAID %%
	‚Ä¢	ETL Logs: Record ingestion, normalization, and validation tasks from hazard datasets (NOAA Storm Events, FEMA Disaster Declarations, USGS Floods).
	‚Ä¢	AI Logs: Capture model decisions, drift alerts, and SHAP-like interpretability metrics to maintain transparency.
	‚Ä¢	System Logs: Document process-level events, including data fetch errors, retries, and environmental context (CPU, container ID, runtime version).

All temporary logs feed into the governance pipeline that produces checksumed, FAIR-compliant summaries (reports/audit/ai_hazards_ledger.json).

‚∏ª

üß≠ Focus Mode Integration

In KFM‚Äôs AI-Powered Focus Mode, hazard data streams are dynamically filtered to show event-linked anomalies or environmental changes.
Logs here act as Focus Telemetry Inputs, feeding insights like:
	‚Ä¢	Drift correlation between datasets (e.g., NOAA flood vs. USGS discharge data).
	‚Ä¢	Semantic correlation: linking a tornado track to power outages or energy hazards.
	‚Ä¢	Confidence metrics for AI summarizations within focus dashboards.

‚∏ª

üîí Data Retention & Compliance

Type	Retention Period	Format	Destination (Post-Processing)
ETL Logs	72 hours	NDJSON	data/work/staging/logs/etl/
AI Logs	48 hours	JSON-LD	data/work/staging/logs/ai/
System Logs	24 hours	TXT/JSON	data/work/staging/logs/system/
Manifest Temp	12 hours	YAML/ZIP	data/checksums/manifests/

All files exceeding retention windows are automatically archived or purged using the repository‚Äôs cron jobs and validated by make logs-validate.

‚∏ª

üß™ Validation & FAIR Alignment
	‚Ä¢	All logs must comply with FAIR Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable).
	‚Ä¢	Schema enforcement via schemas/telemetry/work-hazards-tmp-v13.json.
	‚Ä¢	Cross-validation against STAC metadata ensures alignment with spatial-temporal assets.
	‚Ä¢	Provenance and checksum verification logged under reports/audit/ai_hazards_ledger.json.

‚∏ª

üìà Governance & Audit Chain

All temporary logs eventually roll up into the immutable governance ledger (via blockchain-linked checksums).
They are essential for maintaining transparency in hazard event reconstruction, AI retraining cycles, and ethical oversight.
