# ‚öñÔ∏è Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Hazard Governance Queue**
`data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/tmp/governance_queue/README.md`

**Purpose:** Temporary workspace for pending governance validation events, FAIR+CARE audits, and certification reviews for hazard data pipelines within the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
This directory serves as the intermediate holding area for logs, manifests, and AI governance reports awaiting FAIR+CARE Council verification and official ledger registration.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/tmp/governance_queue/` directory acts as a **temporary staging environment** for governance-related tasks awaiting FAIR+CARE Council approval and provenance certification.  
It includes pre-registered audit logs, validation results, and dataset manifests queued for synchronization with the official **KFM Governance Ledger**.

### Core Functions:
- Queue governance events, FAIR+CARE validations, and certification artifacts for approval.  
- Ensure validation outputs pass automated governance checks before official registration.  
- Provide FAIR+CARE-compliant transparency for pending ethics and audit actions.  
- Serve as a structured holding space prior to final certification and archival.  

All queued items are time-stamped, checksum-verified, and cleared automatically after governance action completion.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Governance Queue Workflow

```mermaid

    A["ETL / AI Validation Outputs"] --> B["Temporary Governance Queue (data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/tmp/governance_queue/)"]
    B --> C["Automated FAIR+CARE Compliance Scan"]
    C --> D["Council Review and Ethics Certification"]
    D --> E["Ledger Registration (data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json)"]
    E --> F["Cleanup and Archival"]
```

### Workflow Description:
1. **Intake:** Validation or audit results automatically pushed into the governance queue.  
2. **Compliance Scan:** Automated FAIR+CARE checks ensure metadata completeness.  
3. **Council Review:** Governance officers review queued files for final certification.  
4. **Ledger Update:** Approved records are registered in the provenance ledger.  
5. **Cleanup:** Temporary queue cleared post-registration and certification confirmation.

## üß† FAIR+CARE Governance Alignment

| Principle | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Findable** | Queued items indexed by governance event type and certification ID. |
| **Accessible** | Open JSON-based governance queue for Council and automation workflows. |
| **Interoperable** | Aligns with FAIR+CARE and DCAT governance standards for provenance tracking. |
| **Reusable** | Retains full metadata context for each queued event. |
| **Collective Benefit** | Ensures transparent, reproducible governance actions. |
| **Authority to Control** | FAIR+CARE Council maintains certification authority over queued items. |
| **Responsibility** | Governance engineers document validation and certification readiness. |
| **Ethics** | Queue management adheres to open, transparent review and certification processes. |

All governance data referenced in:  
`data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json` and  
`data/reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json`.
