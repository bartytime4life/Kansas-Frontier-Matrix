# üßÆ Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Hazard FAIR+CARE Audit Archives**
`data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/archive/fair_audits/README.md`

**Purpose:** Long-term archival repository for FAIR+CARE audit logs, ethical compliance reviews, and governance certifications related to hazard data pipelines in the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
These reports provide historical documentation of ethics validations, data accessibility evaluations, and compliance certifications under FAIR+CARE and MCP-DL v6.3 governance.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/archive/fair_audits/` directory stores **archived FAIR+CARE ethical audit results** from hazard ETL, validation, and governance workflows.  
Each audit file documents data compliance across FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and CARE (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, Ethics) principles for hazard datasets.

### Core Functions:
- Preserve FAIR+CARE compliance reports for hazard datasets.  
- Maintain historical ethics validation results and governance certifications.  
- Support transparent auditing and reproducible data ethics governance.  
- Link archival records to provenance and audit ledgers for accountability.  

All files in this directory are immutable and digitally signed to maintain provenance continuity and ethical certification integrity.

## ‚öôÔ∏è FAIR+CARE Audit Archival Workflow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Active FAIR+CARE Reports (data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/faircare/)"] --> B["Archival Trigger (Quarterly or Post-Release)"]
    B --> C["Checksum Verification and Manifest Generation"]
    C --> D["Transfer to Archive (data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/archive/fair_audits/)"]
    D --> E["Governance Ledger Sync and Ethics Certification"]
```

### Workflow Description:
1. **Audit Validation:** FAIR+CARE reports verified for integrity and completeness.  
2. **Checksum & Manifest:** Hashes generated to ensure authenticity and traceability.  
3. **Archival Transfer:** Reports moved to archive directory with certification metadata.  
4. **Governance Registration:** Entries recorded in provenance ledger.  
5. **Certification:** FAIR+CARE Council confirms final compliance for each audit period.
