## üìö Overview

This report presents the results of **FAIR+CARE compliance evaluations** for all hazard-related data processed during the fourth quarter of 2024.  
Each dataset underwent ethics validation, metadata assessment, and accessibility testing under MCP-DL v6.3 and the KFM FAIR+CARE Governance Framework.

### Summary Objectives:
- Measure compliance against FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) standards.  
- Evaluate CARE (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, Ethics) principles.  
- Document governance approvals and certification outcomes for hazard datasets.  
- Identify areas for continuous improvement in ethical data stewardship.
