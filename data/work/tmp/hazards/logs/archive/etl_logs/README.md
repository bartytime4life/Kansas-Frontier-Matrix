# üßæ Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Hazard ETL Log Archives**
`data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/archive/etl_logs/README.md`

**Purpose:** Centralized repository of archived ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) process logs related to hazard data pipelines in the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
These archives preserve historical ETL execution details, provenance, and governance lineage for auditability and FAIR+CARE compliance.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/archive/etl_logs/` directory stores **archived ETL operation records** from KFM‚Äôs hazard processing pipelines.  
These logs document every extraction, transformation, validation, and load event executed during past workflow cycles, providing historical traceability for data governance and reproducibility studies.

### Core Functions:
- Preserve ETL execution summaries and validation outputs for hazard datasets.  
- Maintain checksum and provenance integrity for archived ETL sessions.  
- Support FAIR+CARE audit investigations and reproducibility validations.  
- Provide lineage continuity between historical and current hazard ETL operations.  

All logs in this workspace are immutable once archived and linked to their corresponding manifest entries and provenance ledger records.

## ‚öôÔ∏è ETL Archival Workflow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Active ETL Logs (data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/etl/)"] --> B["ETL Archival Trigger (Quarterly or Release-Based)"]
    B --> C["Checksum Verification and Metadata Capture"]
    C --> D["Archive Transfer to data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/archive/etl_logs/"]
    D --> E["Governance Ledger Registration and FAIR+CARE Certification"]
```

### Workflow Description:
1. **Extraction:** Active ETL logs verified for completeness and accuracy.  
2. **Checksum Verification:** Each file hashed and stored in manifest for reproducibility.  
3. **Archival Transfer:** Logs moved to archive directory with contextual metadata.  
4. **Governance Registration:** Archival recorded in provenance ledger for traceability.  
5. **Certification:** FAIR+CARE validation ensures ethical, transparent data stewardship.

## üß† FAIR+CARE Governance Alignment

| Principle | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Findable** | Archived logs indexed by ETL cycle and release ID. |
| **Accessible** | Stored in open formats (TXT, JSON) with metadata linkage. |
| **Interoperable** | Aligned with KFM schema standards and manifest registry. |
| **Reusable** | Includes checksum and provenance references for reproducibility. |
| **Collective Benefit** | Ensures transparent data transformation accountability. |
| **Authority to Control** | FAIR+CARE Council governs archival and deletion permissions. |
| **Responsibility** | ETL operators maintain archival documentation. |
| **Ethics** | Logs exclude any sensitive operational or personal identifiers. |

Governance and validation records stored in:  
`data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json`  
and `data/reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json`.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Validation & QA Reports

| Report | Description | Output |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `etl_validation_archive_*.json` | Records results of schema and contract validation. | JSON |
| `etl_manifest_snapshot_*.json` | Manifests listing datasets included in the ETL cycle. | JSON |
| `governance_sync_ledger_*.log` | Audit trail for ledger synchronization events. | Text |
| `metadata.json` | Summarizes checksums, file lineage, and governance linkage. | JSON |

Archival validation and synchronization automated via `etl_archive_sync.yml`.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Governance & Provenance Integration

| Record | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `metadata.json` | Captures runtime metadata and FAIR+CARE certification for archived logs. |
| `data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json` | Logs archival lineage and FAIR+CARE certification. |
| `releases/v9.3.2/manifest.zip` | Registry of checksum and manifest data for archival validation. |

All governance operations are automatically handled through GitHub Actions archival workflows.

---

## üßæ Retention & Integrity Policy

| Log Type | Retention | Policy |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| ETL Execution Logs | Permanent | Archived for long-term audit and reproducibility. |
| Validation Reports | 365 days | Retained for FAIR+CARE re-audit cycles. |
| Governance Sync Logs | Permanent | Immutable governance records. |
| Metadata Files | Permanent | Stored for provenance verification. |

Lifecycle and retention automation governed by `etl_archive_cleanup.yml`.
