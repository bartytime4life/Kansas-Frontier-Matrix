# üì¶ Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Archived AI Models**
`data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/archive/ai_models/README.md`

**Purpose:** Repository for archived AI model binaries, configurations, and metadata associated with hazard prediction pipelines in the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
This directory preserves decommissioned or superseded models for FAIR+CARE governance audits, reproducibility studies, and ethics review purposes.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/archive/ai_models/` directory contains **archived versions of AI hazard prediction models** and their governance-linked metadata.  
Each archived model is retained for lineage tracking, retraining provenance, and FAIR+CARE ethics certification continuity.

### Core Functions:
- Store legacy AI model artifacts for reproducibility and governance validation.  
- Preserve associated configuration files, training parameters, and ethics audit results.  
- Provide reference material for retraining, benchmarking, or model rollback procedures.  
- Ensure model lifecycle transparency under FAIR+CARE and AI governance policies.  

All archived models are immutable, digitally signed, and checksum-verified.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Model Archiving Workflow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Active Model (data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/ai/model_training/)"] --> B["Model Validation and FAIR+CARE Audit"]
    B --> C["Governance Certification (data/reports/audit/ai_hazards_ledger.json)"]
    C --> D["Archive to data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/archive/ai_models/"]
    D --> E["Checksum and Metadata Registration (manifest.zip)"]
```

### Workflow Description:
1. **Certification:** Completed models undergo validation and FAIR+CARE audits before archiving.  
2. **Governance Sync:** Lineage, ethics, and training metadata stored in provenance ledgers.  
3. **Archiving:** Certified models compressed, hashed, and archived with metadata.  
4. **Access Control:** Only read access permitted; models are immutable and protected.  
5. **Publication:** Archive entries indexed in AI Governance Ledger for historical reference.

## üß† FAIR+CARE AI Governance Summary

| Principle | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Findable** | All archived models indexed in `archive_manifest.json` and governance ledgers. |
| **Accessible** | Models stored in protected, read-only directories for governance access. |
| **Interoperable** | Model binaries stored in open serialization standards (Pickle, ONNX). |
| **Reusable** | Metadata includes configuration, checksum, and FAIR+CARE certification. |
| **Collective Benefit** | Enables ethical oversight and transparent model lifecycle tracking. |
| **Authority to Control** | FAIR+CARE Council and AI Governance
