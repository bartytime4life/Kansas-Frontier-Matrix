## 📚 Overview

This QA summary consolidates all validation and FAIR+CARE audit outcomes from **hazard data pipelines processed during Q4 2024**.  
It documents schema checks, governance linkages, and validation performance metrics aligned with MCP-DL v6.3 and FAIR+CARE certification standards.

### Objectives:
- Summarize schema and metadata validation for hazard datasets.  
- Document FAIR+CARE ethics audits and governance ledger entries.  
- Record overall data quality metrics and validation success rates.  
- Maintain audit readiness and ethical traceability for all datasets.
