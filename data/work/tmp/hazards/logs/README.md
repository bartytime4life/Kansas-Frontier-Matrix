# üå™Ô∏è Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Hazards Log System**
`data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/README.md`

**Purpose:** Central index and coordination layer for all hazard-related log directories, covering ETL, AI, validation, system, and archival operations.  
Enables traceable, multi-domain observability for every hazard data product under the Master Coder Protocol (MCP-DL v6.3).

## üìö Overview

The **Hazards Log System** aggregates all operational, analytical, and governance logs for the **Hazards TMP workspace**.  
It serves as the central observability layer for ETL data pipelines, AI/ML systems, Focus Mode reasoning, validation reports, and archival records.  
Each subdirectory represents a functional subsystem in the hazard analytics lifecycle ‚Äî from extraction and transformation to ethics validation and audit.

This unified structure provides a **single point of reference** for:
- Data lineage tracking  
- AI model performance & drift reports  
- FAIR/CARE compliance verification  
- System telemetry & uptime auditing  
- Governance traceability (MCP ledger integration)

C --> D[AI Logs]
D --> E[Sessions + System Logs]
E --> F[Manifest + Archive Logs]

This cyclical structure ensures that each data cycle ‚Äî from ingestion to AI interpretation ‚Äî is continuously audited and reproducible.  
Logs serve as **verifiable checkpoints** in the hazard intelligence chain.

## üß© Log Functions Overview

| Log Type | Purpose | Frequency | Retention Policy |
|-----------|----------|------------|------------------|
| **ETL Logs** | Capture extraction, transformation, and loading details. | Daily | Archived quarterly |
| **AI Logs** | Track model training, inference, drift, and explainability metrics. | Continuous | Retained for 3 major versions |
| **Validation Logs** | Store QA, STAC, and schema conformity reports. | Per ETL run | Permanent |
| **Energy Logs** | Monitor energy hazard exposure and resilience modeling. | Monthly | 1-year retention |
| **System Logs** | Record uptime, health checks, and resource metrics. | Continuous | 90-day rolling window |
| **Sessions Logs** | Record user/AI session metadata for telemetry. | Per user/AI session | Permanent |
| **Manifests Logs** | Publish dataset integrity, checksums, and STAC links. | Per release | Permanent |
| **Archive Logs** | Retain finalized legacy datasets and reports. | Quarterly | Permanent |
| **TMP Logs** | Store temporary drafts before validation. | Continuous | 7-day retention |

## üß† Focus Mode Integration

The Hazards Log System underpins **Focus Mode AI reasoning**, providing:
- Real-time context for all hazard layers (spatial, temporal, and thematic).
- Access to model provenance and validation metrics.  
- Interactive replay of ETL or AI sessions for explainability.  
- Automatic data integrity verification via checksum manifests.  
- Feedback for drift retraining pipelines (AI self-governance).

Focus Mode modules actively read from:
- `ai/` for reasoning summaries  
- `validation/` for dataset readiness  
- `system/` for health telemetry  
- `tmp/` for live insight previews

## üß© FAIR+CARE Compliance

FAIR Principles:
- **Findable:** All logs are indexed in the STAC catalog with descriptive metadata.  
- **Accessible:** Public logs and metadata available via repository and API exports.  
- **Interoperable:** JSON, CSV, and Markdown formats aligned with ISO 19115, STAC, and DCAT.  
- **Reusable:** Full provenance and checksum verification ensure reproducibility.  

CARE Principles:
- **Collective Benefit:** Supports transparent, community-aligned hazard analytics.  
- **Authority to Control:** Communities retain governance over sensitive spatial layers.  
- **Responsibility:** Logs undergo continual ethical review by the FAIR+CARE Council.  
- **Ethics:** Embeds MCP-compliant governance in all data and AI processes.
