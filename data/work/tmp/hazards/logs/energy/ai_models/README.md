# ‚ö° Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Energy AI Models for Hazard Analytics**
`data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/energy/ai_models/README.md`

**Purpose:** Repository for energy-related AI and ML models developed for hazard prediction, resilience analytics, and infrastructure impact assessment within the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
This directory documents AI model configurations, training metadata, and validation reports linking energy systems with natural hazard data under FAIR+CARE governance.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/energy/ai_models/` directory contains **AI and ML models focused on hazard-energy interactions**, including predictive models assessing grid reliability, renewable energy disruption, and cascading hazard impacts.  
These models integrate environmental hazard datasets (flood, drought, storm) with energy infrastructure data (grid topology, generation assets, pipelines) to support resilient energy planning and risk mitigation.

### Core Functions:
- Develop and store AI/ML models analyzing hazard impacts on energy systems.  
- Record model architectures, hyperparameters, and training data sources.  
- Maintain FAIR+CARE-aligned audit and governance metadata for ethical AI operation.  
- Support explainability, bias detection, and validation for energy hazard forecasting.  

All AI models are FAIR+CARE-audited and registered in the **AI Governance Ledger** for traceability and accountability.

```

### Workflow Description:
1. **Training:** Energy AI models trained using integrated hazard datasets (NOAA, FEMA, USGS) and energy system data (DOE EIA, grid assets).  
2. **Validation:** FAIR+CARE compliance audit and schema verification performed on all trained models.  
3. **Explainability:** Interpretability metrics generated via SHAP, LIME, and attention-based visualization.  
4. **Governance:** Model metadata registered in `data/reports/audit/ai_hazards_ledger.json`.  
5. **Deployment:** Certified models promoted for use in hazard simulation and resilience analytics.
