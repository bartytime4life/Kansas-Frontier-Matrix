# üìä Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Energy System Summaries for Hazard Analytics**
`data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/energy/summaries/README.md`

**Purpose:** Repository for summary analytics, FAIR+CARE compliance digests, and governance dashboards integrating energy infrastructure data with hazard risk assessments in the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
This workspace consolidates high-level performance, validation, and ethics summaries across all energy‚Äìhazard AI and ETL pipelines.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/energy/summaries/` directory compiles **aggregated summaries and audit digests** of ETL, validation, AI model, and drift monitoring activities for hazard‚Äìenergy integration pipelines.  
These summaries provide FAIR+CARE-certified transparency into energy resilience modeling, hazard forecasting accuracy, and ethics governance outcomes.

### Core Functions:
- Summarize performance and ethics outcomes for integrated energy‚Äìhazard workflows.  
- Record AI and ETL success rates, schema conformance, and governance traceability.  
- Generate FAIR+CARE summary dashboards for internal review and reporting.  
- Maintain lineage continuity between operational logs and governance audits.  

All summary artifacts are version-controlled, checksum-verified, and registered in the **KFM Governance Ledger**.

    B --> C["Generate FAIR+CARE and Performance Summaries"]
    C --> D["Governance Dashboard and Provenance Registration"]
```

### Workflow Description:
1. **Data Aggregation:** Collect and normalize validation and AI log metrics across energy and hazard systems.  
2. **FAIR+CARE Compilation:** Combine ethics, reproducibility, and accessibility scores.  
3. **Performance Summary:** Calculate KPIs such as model accuracy, ETL throughput, and validation success rate.  
4. **Governance Dashboard:** Summarize findings in Markdown and JSON dashboards.  
5. **Ledger Registration:** Publish provenance and certification records to governance registry.

## üß† FAIR+CARE Compliance Summary

| Principle | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Findable** | Summary artifacts indexed by governance cycle and energy domain. |
| **Accessible** | Reports published in open JSON, CSV, and Markdown formats. |
| **Interoperable** | Data aligned with FAIR+CARE schemas and governance dashboards. |
| **Reusable** | All summaries include provenance metadata and checksum registry. |
| **Collective Benefit** | Promotes transparency and trust in energy‚Äìhazard resilience research. |
| **Authority to Control** | FAIR+CARE Council certifies ethics compliance. |
| **Responsibility** | Validation and AI teams provide complete performance documentation. |
| **Ethics** | Ensures equitable, non-biased integration of hazard and energy data. |

Certification and lineage records found in:  
`data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json` and  
`data/reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json`.
