# üìâ Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Energy Drift Monitoring for Hazard AI Systems**
`data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/energy/drift_monitoring/README.md`

**Purpose:** Repository for monitoring and auditing data drift, model drift, and ethics compliance in energy-integrated hazard AI models within the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
This workspace ensures that predictive energy resilience and hazard interaction models maintain accuracy, fairness, and compliance under FAIR+CARE governance protocols.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/energy/drift_monitoring/` directory tracks **model drift and input data distribution changes** for energy-hazard AI systems.  
It captures statistical shifts, bias drift, and governance alerts triggered during model inference or retraining cycles ‚Äî providing a fully auditable drift-monitoring framework for FAIR+CARE-certified AI operations.

### Core Functions:
- Detect concept and data drift in AI models linking hazards with energy networks.  
- Log feature distribution, bias metrics, and model performance over time.  
- Maintain FAIR+CARE-aligned ethics audit for every detected drift event.  
- Support retraining, governance certification, and transparency in AI-driven energy resilience analytics.  

All drift logs are synchronized with the **AI Governance Ledger** for continuous compliance verification.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Drift Monitoring Workflow

    C --> D["Drift Reporting and Governance Alert Generation"]
    D --> E["Retraining Trigger and Provenance Registration"]
```

### Workflow Description:
1. **Model Observation:** Monitor predictions and feature distributions from energy-hazard AI models.  
2. **Drift Detection:** Detect statistical and ethical drift using PSI, KL divergence, and bias score indices.  
3. **Audit Review:** Conduct FAIR+CARE bias audits for detected anomalies.  
4. **Governance Logging:** Record drift events in the AI Governance Ledger for oversight.  
5. **Retraining Trigger:** Initiate retraining if drift exceeds established FAIR+CARE thresholds.

## üß† FAIR+CARE AI Governance Alignment

| Principle | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Findable** | Drift reports indexed by model ID, cycle, and checksum. |
| **Accessible** | Reports stored in open JSON and CSV formats for review. |
| **Interoperable** | Aligned with KFM AI governance schema and FAIR+CARE audit models. |
| **Reusable** | Metadata includes lineage, validation context, and FAIR+CARE status. |
| **Collective Benefit** | Protects energy and environmental resilience through ethical AI oversight. |
| **Authority to Control** | FAIR+CARE Council oversees retraining authorization and drift thresholds. |
| **Responsibility** | AI maintainers document drift detection, retraining, and validation outcomes. |
| **Ethics** | Drift metrics interpreted within ethical frameworks for responsible AI operations. |

Governance logs and certification metadata stored in:  
`data/reports/audit/ai_hazards_ledger.json`  
and `data/reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Drift Monitoring Metrics

| Metric | Description | Threshold |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| **Population Stability Index (PSI)** | Measures shift in input distributions. | > 0.2 = retraining required |
| **KL Divergence** | Quantifies deviation between probability distributions. | > 0.15 = model drift detected |
| **Bias Shift Score** | Indicates changes in fairness and demographic balance. | > 0.1 = ethical review triggered |
| **Accuracy Delta** | Detects change in model predictive performance. | ¬±5% from baseline triggers validation |
| **FAIR+CARE Compliance** | Verifies ethical and reproducible AI operation. | ‚â• 98% = certified |

Drift detection pipelines automated by `energy_drift_monitor.yml`.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Governance & Provenance Integration

| Record | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `metadata.json` | Captures governance linkage, checksums, and drift audit metadata. |
| `data/reports/audit/ai_hazards_ledger.json` | Logs drift monitoring lineage, ethics review, and retraining actions. |
