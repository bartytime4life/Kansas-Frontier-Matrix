# ‚úÖ Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Energy Validation Logs for Hazard Integration**
`data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/energy/validation/README.md`

**Purpose:** Repository for validation reports, FAIR+CARE audits, and QA logs generated during the integration of energy system data with hazard analytics pipelines in the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
This workspace ensures that all energy‚Äìhazard data joins, transformations, and AI-driven models meet schema, ethics, and reproducibility standards under MCP-DL v6.3.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/energy/validation/` directory contains **validation artifacts** for cross-domain energy and hazard datasets.  
Each log verifies schema conformance, FAIR+CARE ethics compliance, and governance linkage for ETL and AI workflows integrating energy infrastructure and hazard intelligence.

### Core Functions:
- Validate energy‚Äìhazard data pipelines for schema and ethics compliance.  
- Verify interoperability between hazard datasets and energy metadata models.  
- Record FAIR+CARE audit outcomes and governance synchronization results.  
- Maintain reproducibility and provenance for all validation activities.  

All validation records are registered in the **KFM Governance Ledger** to preserve audit readiness and lineage traceability.

    B --> C["FAIR and CARE Compliance Audit"]
    C --> D["Generate Validation Reports and Summaries"]
    D --> E["Governance Registration and Provenance Certification"]
```

### Workflow Description:
1. **Schema Validation:** Verify data structure alignment between energy infrastructure and hazard data.  
2. **FAIR+CARE Audit:** Conduct ethics, accessibility, and provenance checks.  
3. **Reporting:** Compile machine-readable validation JSON and human-readable QA summaries.  
4. **Governance Registration:** Synchronize validation results with KFM‚Äôs provenance ledger.  
5. **Certification:** Confirm data readiness for processing, AI modeling, and publication.

## üß† FAIR+CARE Governance Summary

| Principle | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Findable** | Validation logs indexed by ETL cycle and integration domain. |
| **Accessible** | Reports stored in open JSON, CSV, and Markdown formats. |
| **Interoperable** | Schema alignment validated across hazard and energy metadata. |
| **Reusable** | Each record contains provenance, schema reference, and checksum. |
| **Collective Benefit** | Supports reliable, ethical, and sustainable energy analytics. |
| **Authority to Control** | FAIR+CARE Council certifies each validation cycle. |
| **Responsibility** | Validation team ensures reproducibility and audit traceability. |
| **Ethics** | Guarantees open, unbiased integration between hazard and energy data. |

FAIR+CARE validation results documented in:  
`data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json`  
and `data/reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json`.
