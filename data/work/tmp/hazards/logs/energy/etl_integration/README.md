# ‚öôÔ∏è Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Energy ETL Integration for Hazard Systems**
`data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/energy/etl_integration/README.md`

**Purpose:** Repository for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) integration logs and validation reports connecting energy infrastructure datasets with hazard intelligence pipelines within the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
This workspace tracks cross-domain data flows, schema harmonization, and FAIR+CARE governance verification for energy‚Äìhazard interoperability.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/energy/etl_integration/` directory documents **ETL processes that integrate hazard and energy data streams**, including renewable generation assets, transmission infrastructure, and environmental risk layers.  
It provides audit-ready transparency for all cross-domain transformations and schema mappings performed under FAIR+CARE data governance.

### Core Functions:
- Track ETL jobs combining hazard intelligence with energy datasets.  
- Record schema harmonization, validation, and provenance metadata.  
- Support FAIR+CARE certification and governance synchronization of ETL operations.  
- Enable traceable, ethical, and reproducible integration of multi-domain data pipelines.  

All ETL integration events logged here are immutable and linked to the **KFM Data Provenance Ledger** for complete traceability.

    B --> C["Schema Harmonization and Metadata Validation"]
    C --> D["FAIR+CARE Audit and Governance Logging"]
    D --> E["Integration Summary and Provenance Registration"]
```

### Workflow Description:
1. **Extraction:** Energy datasets (grid assets, pipelines, renewables) and hazard sources ingested into unified ETL environment.  
2. **Transformation:** Schema harmonization aligns energy infrastructure fields with hazard geospatial attributes.  
3. **Validation:** FAIR+CARE ethics and schema compliance checks performed automatically.  
4. **Governance:** ETL events registered in provenance ledger for accountability.  
5. **Publication:** Harmonized data ready for AI model ingestion and staging transfer.

## üß† FAIR+CARE Integration Compliance Summary

| Principle | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Findable** | ETL integrations logged with unique IDs and dataset lineage. |
| **Accessible** | Transformation results stored in open CSV and JSON formats. |
| **Interoperable** | Schema mappings harmonized across hazard and energy domains. |
| **Reusable** | Metadata includes provenance, schema documentation, and FAIR+CARE tags. |
| **Collective Benefit** | Supports resilience research, energy risk modeling, and transparency. |
| **Authority to Control** | FAIR+CARE Council authorizes integration of cross-domain pipelines. |
| **Responsibility** | Validators ensure schema mappings are reproducible and ethically sound. |
| **Ethics** | Integration excludes sensitive or proprietary data; ensures equitable use. |

Audit data referenced in:  
`data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json` and
