# üì• Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Hazard ETL Extract Logs**
`data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/etl/extract/README.md`

**Purpose:** Repository for extract-phase ETL logs documenting data sourcing, ingestion, and pre-transformation operations for hazard datasets in the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
These logs capture data provenance, schema discovery, and FAIR+CARE pre-audits during the extract stage of KFM‚Äôs hazard data pipelines.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/etl/extract/` directory contains **extraction-stage logs** for all raw hazard data sources ingested into KFM‚Äôs ETL pipelines.  
Each log provides evidence of dataset provenance, extraction timing, schema identification, and source compliance under FAIR+CARE governance.

### Core Functions:
- Document hazard dataset extractions from raw sources (NOAA, FEMA, USGS, NIDIS).  
- Record dataset origin metadata, file types, and integrity checksums.  
- Validate FAIR+CARE accessibility and licensing during ingestion.  
- Maintain traceability for all extract operations across hazard data workflows.  

All extraction records are immutable and versioned for governance audit reproducibility.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Extraction Workflow

    A["Raw Data Sources (NOAA, FEMA, USGS, NIDIS)"] --> B["Extraction Engine (ETL: Extract Phase)"]
    B --> C["Schema Detection and Integrity Checks"]
    C --> D["FAIR+CARE Audit for Accessibility and Ethics"]
    D --> E["Governance Ledger Registration"]
```

### Workflow Description:
1. **Data Retrieval:** Raw hazard datasets downloaded or accessed via API connectors.  
2. **Schema Identification:** Extracted fields analyzed for structural and metadata alignment.  
3. **Integrity Validation:** Checksums calculated and compared to source manifests.  
4. **FAIR+CARE Pre-Audit:** Confirm dataset licensing, ethical use, and accessibility compliance.  
5. **Governance Registration:** Extraction event recorded in provenance ledger.

## üß† FAIR+CARE Governance Alignment

| Principle | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Findable** | Extraction events indexed by source endpoint and ETL cycle. |
| **Accessible** | Extraction metadata available under open FAIR+CARE schema. |
| **Interoperable** | Schema harmonized with DCAT and KFM metadata contracts. |
| **Reusable** | Metadata includes provenance, schema mappings, and licensing. |
| **Collective Benefit** | Promotes open data transparency and hazard research collaboration. |
| **Authority to Control** | FAIR+CARE Council validates all extraction sources. |
| **Responsibility** | ETL teams document extraction parameters and validation checks. |
| **Ethics** | Ensures all datasets respect ethical, legal, and accessibility standards. |

Governance and audit entries recorded in:  
`data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json`  
and `data/reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Extraction Artifacts

| File | Description | Format |
|------|--------------|--------|
| `extract_run_log_*.log` | Raw log of extraction processes, sources, and results. | Text |
| `data_source_registry_*.json` | Details extracted data origins and FAIR+CARE validation. | JSON |
| `checksum_verification_report_*.json` | Records hash integrity validation for all raw files. | JSON |
| `schema_discovery_summary_*.csv` | Field and schema-level structure summaries. | CSV |
