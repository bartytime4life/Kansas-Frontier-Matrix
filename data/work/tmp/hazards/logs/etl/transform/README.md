# üîÑ Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Hazard ETL Transform Logs**
`data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/etl/transform/README.md`

**Purpose:** Repository for transformation-phase ETL logs that document schema normalization, data harmonization, and FAIR+CARE validation activities for hazard datasets within the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
These logs preserve transformation metadata, QA results, and governance lineage for every processing cycle, ensuring transparency, reproducibility, and ethical data management.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/etl/transform/` directory captures **ETL transformation-phase operations**, recording data standardization, schema validation, and FAIR+CARE governance checks.  
Each transformation log documents how extracted hazard data is cleaned, structured, and harmonized into standardized KFM schema formats.

### Core Functions:
- Log field-level transformations and schema normalization processes.  
- Document data quality improvements and transformation metrics.  
- Record FAIR+CARE compliance audits for ethical transformation governance.  
- Provide lineage links between raw inputs and processed hazard datasets.  

All transformation records are checksum-verified, governance-synced, and linked to the **Provenance Ledger** for long-term auditability.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Transformation Workflow

    A["Extracted Hazard Data (data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/etl/extract/)"] --> B["Transformation Scripts (ETL: Transform Phase)"]
    B --> C["Schema Normalization and Data Harmonization"]
    C --> D["FAIR+CARE Validation and Quality Assurance"]
    D --> E["Governance Registration and Provenance Logging"]
```

### Workflow Description:
1. **Input:** Ingest raw hazard datasets from extract-phase logs.  
2. **Transformation:** Apply field normalization, value mapping, and schema harmonization.  
3. **Quality Assurance:** Validate completeness, consistency, and referential integrity.  
4. **FAIR+CARE Review:** Verify that transformation logic aligns with ethical data principles.  
5. **Governance Sync:** Record transformations in provenance ledger for traceability.

## üß† FAIR+CARE Governance Alignment

| Principle | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Findable** | Transformation logs indexed by ETL cycle and dataset lineage. |
| **Accessible** | Stored in open JSON, CSV, and text formats for governance use. |
| **Interoperable** | Aligned with KFM schema contracts and STAC/DCAT standards. |
| **Reusable** | Logs include provenance, schema validation, and transformation metrics. |
| **Collective Benefit** | Promotes transparency and open reproducibility of hazard data transformations. |
| **Authority to Control** | FAIR+CARE Council validates ethical transformation workflows. |
| **Responsibility** | ETL engineers document all transformation logic and QA results. |
| **Ethics** | Ensures transformations uphold ethical representation and data integrity. |

Governance and validation references stored in:  
`data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json`  
and `data/reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json`.
