# üìä Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Hazard ETL Summaries**
`data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/etl/summaries/README.md`

**Purpose:** Repository for summary reports, FAIR+CARE audit digests, and performance analytics generated across the hazard ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline in the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
These summaries consolidate metrics, compliance results, and lineage statistics from all ETL stages to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and data governance accountability.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/etl/summaries/` directory contains **aggregate ETL performance and governance summaries** compiled from extract, transform, load, and lineage stages.  
Each summary provides FAIR+CARE audit results, schema validation metrics, and quality assurance indicators for hazard data workflows executed within KFM‚Äôs reproducible data environment.

### Core Functions:
- Aggregate ETL statistics from extraction through final load.  
- Summarize validation, FAIR+CARE certification, and governance metrics.  
- Provide high-level QA dashboards for data lifecycle transparency.  
- Support reproducibility, ethics compliance, and audit readiness.  

All summaries are automatically generated by governance workflows and version-tracked through the KFM **Provenance Ledger**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è ETL Summary Workflow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["ETL Stage Logs (Extract / Transform / Load / Lineage)"] --> B["Aggregate Metrics and QA Results"]
    B --> C["Generate FAIR+CARE and Governance Summary"]
    C --> D["Publish ETL Summary to data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/etl/summaries/"]
    D --> E["Register Summary in Provenance Ledger"]
```

### Workflow Description:
1. **Aggregation:** Collect metrics, validation logs, and audit reports from all ETL stages.  
2. **FAIR+CARE Review:** Compile ethical governance compliance and reproducibility metrics.  
3. **Dashboard Creation:** Generate human-readable and machine-readable governance summaries.  
4. **Ledger Registration:** Log ETL summary records in `data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json`.  
5. **Publication:** Archive results for governance review and future reproducibility audits.

## üß† FAIR+CARE Governance Summary

| Principle | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Findable** | ETL summaries indexed by cycle and version in governance ledger. |
| **Accessible** | Reports stored in open JSON, CSV, and Markdown formats. |
| **Interoperable** | Schema aligned with FAIR+CARE audit and data governance standards. |
| **Reusable** | Summaries contain provenance, validation, and checksum data. |
| **Collective Benefit** | Enables transparent ETL performance tracking and ethical data validation. |
| **Authority to Control** | FAIR+CARE Council oversees audit and certification issuance. |
| **Responsibility** | ETL teams document all stages of data transformation and validation. |
| **Ethics** | Maintains transparency, avoids bias, and ensures open governance accountability. |

All governance references are maintained in:  
`data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json`  
and `data/reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json`.
