# üß¨ Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Hazard ETL Lineage Logs**
`data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/etl/lineage/README.md`

**Purpose:** Repository for lineage tracking, provenance verification, and transformation mapping logs generated by hazard ETL pipelines within the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
This workspace captures full data movement across extraction, transformation, and validation phases, ensuring FAIR+CARE traceability and reproducibility.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/tmp/hazards/logs/etl/lineage/` directory documents **dataset lineage across ETL workflows**, connecting source, transformation, and validation artifacts under KFM‚Äôs FAIR+CARE governance system.  
Each log provides detailed provenance of data movements, schema relationships, and transformation dependencies for hazard datasets.

### Core Functions:
- Record dataset lineage across extract, transform, and validation stages.  
- Track schema evolution, transformation dependencies, and governance linkage.  
- Provide provenance metadata for audit reproducibility and FAIR+CARE compliance.  
- Serve as the authoritative lineage record for hazard ETL data flows.  

All lineage logs are checksum-verified and registered in the KFM **Governance Ledger** to maintain full audit traceability.

```

### Workflow Description:
1. **Capture:** All ETL operations automatically generate lineage records linking source ‚Üí transformation ‚Üí validated dataset.  
2. **Schema Mapping:** Field-level mapping recorded in `schema_evolution_map_*.json` for reproducibility.  
3. **Audit Logging:** Provenance chain verified and checksum-registered in governance manifest.  
4. **Certification:** FAIR+CARE Council validates lineage consistency and transformation integrity.  
5. **Publication:** Summaries integrated into `data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json`.

## üß† FAIR+CARE Governance Alignment

| Principle | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Findable** | Lineage logs indexed by ETL cycle and dataset ID. |
| **Accessible** | Open JSON, Markdown, and CSV outputs for governance audits. |
| **Interoperable** | Follows PROV-O, DCAT, and STAC lineage conventions. |
| **Reusable** | Metadata provides schema evolution and checksum references. |
| **Collective Benefit** | Enables transparent, auditable hazard data workflows. |
| **Authority to Control** | FAIR+CARE Council validates transformation traceability. |
| **Responsibility** | ETL engineers maintain lineage accuracy and governance records. |
| **Ethics** | Guarantees reproducible and accountable data stewardship. |

All lineage validations registered within:  
`data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json` and  
`data/reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json`.
