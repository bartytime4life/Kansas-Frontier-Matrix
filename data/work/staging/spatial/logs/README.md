# üó∫Ô∏è Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Spatial Logs**
`data/work/staging/spatial/logs/README.md`

**Purpose:** Records the execution, validation, and governance audit logs for spatial data transformations performed within the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
These logs ensure full traceability of reprojection, clipping, merging, and FAIR+CARE spatial compliance workflows executed in the staging environment.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/staging/spatial/logs/` directory archives all **execution traces and audit logs related to spatial data processing and validation.**  
This includes reprojection summaries, geometry validation outputs, and synchronization logs connecting staging datasets to the global governance ledger.

These logs serve to:
- Document CRS normalization and geometry correction actions.  
- Track spatial ETL steps, such as merging, clipping, and reprojection.  
- Log FAIR+CARE compliance assessments for geographic data ethics.  
- Maintain checksum records for provenance and integrity verification.  

All logs adhere to MCP-DL v6.3 logging standards and are FAIR+CARE-auditable.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Spatial Logging Workflow

    B --> C["FAIR and CARE Spatial Ethics Review"]
    C --> D["Generate Spatial Logs and Metadata"]
    D --> E["Sync Governance Ledger and Provenance Checksums"]
```

### Workflow Summary:
1. **Preprocessing:** Logs start when spatial files are loaded for transformation.  
2. **Validation:** CRS, geometry, and topology corrections recorded line by line.  
3. **Ethical Audit:** FAIR+CARE compliance events tracked in `governance_sync.log`.  
4. **Governance:** Provenance entries linked with audit ledger for reproducibility.

## üß† FAIR+CARE Governance for Spatial Logging

| Principle | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Findable** | Logs include spatial dataset references and validation IDs. |
| **Accessible** | Logs are machine-readable and auditable via governance council access. |
| **Interoperable** | Stored in open formats (TXT, JSON) for use across QA systems. |
| **Reusable** | Linked to data provenance and STAC catalog metadata. |
| **Collective Benefit** | Promotes reproducible geospatial transformations and integrity. |
| **Authority to Control** | FAIR+CARE Council oversees all reprojection and validation processes. |
| **Responsibility** | Validators must record all topology fixes and CRS normalizations. |
| **Ethics** | Ensures cultural and jurisdictional geographic boundaries are respected. |

Audit and compliance results stored in:  
`data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json` and `data/reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Log Categories

| File | Description | Format |
|------|--------------|--------|
| `spatial_pipeline_run.log` | Execution trace of spatial ETL pipeline operations. | Text |
| `reprojection_summary.log` | CRS normalization and reprojection report. | Text |
| `geometry_validation.log` | Detailed geometry integrity validation results. | Text |
| `governance_sync.log` | Governance synchronization summary and FAIR+CARE linkage. | Text |
| `metadata.json` | Log provenance, checksum, and governance reference. | JSON |

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Governance & Provenance Integration

| Record | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `metadata.json` | Defines runtime context, validator ID, and log checksums. |
| `data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json` | Central record of spatial process lineage and checksums. |
| `data/reports/validation/stac_validation_report.json` | Tracks STAC spatial metadata compliance. |
| `releases/v9.3.2/manifest.zip` | Manifest of validated log hashes and integrity data. |

Governance synchronization automated by `spatial_log_sync.yml`.

---

## üßæ Retention Policy

| Log Type | Retention Duration | Policy |
|-----------|--------------------|--------|
| Spatial Pipeline Logs | 90 days | Archived quarterly for governance review. |
| CRS and Reprojection Logs | 60 days | Purged after validation approval. |
| Geometry Validation Logs | 180 days | Retained for FAIR+CARE spatial QA. |
| Governance Sync Logs | 365 days | Stored permanently for provenance tracking. |

Purge automation managed by `spatial_log_cleanup.yml`.
