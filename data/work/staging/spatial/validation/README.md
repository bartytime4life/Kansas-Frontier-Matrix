# ‚úÖ Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Spatial Validation Workspace**
`data/work/staging/spatial/validation/README.md`

**Purpose:** Performs geometry integrity checks, CRS validation, FAIR+CARE spatial ethics audits, and STAC metadata verification for geospatial datasets within Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
Ensures all spatial data adhere to technical, ethical, and interoperability standards before being promoted to processed or archival layers.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/staging/spatial/validation/` directory is the **governed validation environment** where spatial datasets undergo technical, schema, and ethical reviews.  
It acts as the quality assurance layer bridging raw and processed spatial data.

### Key Responsibilities:
- Verify CRS and bounding box alignment (EPSG:4326).  
- Check geometry validity, topology integrity, and feature completeness.  
- Validate STAC/DCAT spatial metadata for discoverability.  
- Run FAIR+CARE audits on ethical and territorial correctness.  
- Record validation outcomes and governance approvals.

All validation activities are logged and cross-referenced with provenance records in the governance ledger.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Spatial Validation Workflow

    C --> D["FAIR+CARE Ethics and Territorial Audit"]
    D --> E["Write Reports to data/work/staging/spatial/validation/"]
    E --> F["Governance Ledger and Manifest Update"]
```

### Workflow Description:
1. **Geometry Check:** Detect and correct invalid, null, or self-intersecting geometries.  
2. **CRS Verification:** Confirm all datasets use EPSG:4326 projection.  
3. **Metadata Review:** Ensure completeness of STAC/DCAT fields and spatial coverage tags.  
4. **Ethics Audit:** Validate territorial boundaries, Indigenous lands, and ethical representation.  
5. **Governance Sync:** Log results and checksum into provenance ledger.

## üß† FAIR+CARE Validation Criteria

| Validation Category | Description | Tool / Standard | Output |
|----------------------|-------------|------------------|---------|
| **Geometry Integrity** | Validates geometry correctness and topology consistency. | Shapely / GDAL | `geometry_validation_report.json` |
| **CRS Alignment** | Verifies projection and bounding box coverage. | pyproj / Fiona | `crs_check_summary.json` |
| **Metadata Compliance** | STAC and DCAT field completeness review. | stac-validator | `stac_spatial_compliance.json` |
| **FAIR+CARE Ethics Audit** | Reviews boundaries and ethical alignment with territorial data. | faircare-validator | `faircare_spatial_audit.json` |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è FAIR+CARE Spatial Compliance Overview

| Principle | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Findable** | STAC items indexed with bounding boxes and CRS metadata. |
| **Accessible** | Metadata available for public and internal governance review. |
| **Interoperable** | All spatial datasets use EPSG:4326 and standardized formats. |
| **Reusable** | Provenance metadata ensures reproducibility and ethical use. |
| **Collective Benefit** | Promotes open, responsible spatial data sharing. |
| **Authority to Control** | FAIR+CARE Council oversees spatial data validation workflows. |
| **Responsibility** | Validators record CRS and geometry corrections in governance logs. |
| **Ethics** | Ensures representation of Indigenous and jurisdictional boundaries with respect. |

FAIR+CARE results stored in:  
`data/reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json` and `data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json`.
