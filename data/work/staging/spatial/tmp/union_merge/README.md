# üåê Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Spatial Union & Merge TMP Workspace**
`data/work/staging/spatial/tmp/union_merge/README.md`

**Purpose:** Temporary environment for combining, fusing, and harmonizing multiple spatial datasets during Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM) ETL processing.  
This layer enables merging and unioning of geospatial layers (e.g., flood zones, hazard boundaries, hydrology networks) to create unified, governance-compliant spatial composites.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/staging/spatial/tmp/union_merge/` directory serves as a **temporary workspace for spatial union and merge operations**.  
It is designed to combine multiple geospatial datasets into a unified layer while maintaining topological integrity, CRS alignment, and FAIR+CARE ethical transparency.

### Key Objectives:
- Merge polygon and line datasets with consistent attributes.  
- Perform spatial joins and attribute harmonization across sources.  
- Resolve geometry overlaps, gaps, and duplicates.  
- Create merged layers for hazard, hydrology, and climate mapping.  
- Ensure FAIR+CARE compliance in data integration processes.  

All outputs here are **temporary artifacts**, regenerated as part of automated ETL runs and validated before promotion to the processed layer.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Spatial Merge Workflow

    A["Normalized Spatial Inputs (data/work/staging/spatial/tmp/reprojection/)"] --> B["Attribute Alignment and Field Mapping"]
    B --> C["Geometry Merge and Topology Union"]
    C --> D["Metadata Harmonization and FAIR+CARE Audit"]
    D --> E["Validation and Governance Registration"]
```

### Workflow Description:
1. **Attribute Alignment:** Standardize field names, schema, and CRS for input datasets.  
2. **Geometry Merge:** Use geospatial tools to merge and union polygon and line features.  
3. **Validation:** Check topological integrity, dissolve rules, and attribute preservation.  
4. **FAIR+CARE Audit:** Ensure ethical boundary representation and provenance accuracy.  
5. **Governance:** Record operation metadata in `data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json`.

## üß† FAIR+CARE Spatial Integration Governance

| Principle | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Findable** | Each merged dataset documented with ID, CRS, and source lineage. |
| **Accessible** | Open GeoJSON output; metadata aligned with STAC/DCAT standards. |
| **Interoperable** | CRS normalized to EPSG:4326; attributes harmonized via schema mapping. |
| **Reusable** | Provenance chain recorded; checksums validated for all source layers. |
| **Collective Benefit** | Promotes open, ethical reuse of integrated environmental data. |
| **Authority to Control** | FAIR+CARE Council reviews integration workflows. |
| **Responsibility** | Validators ensure proper field mapping and topology preservation. |
| **Ethics** | Boundary-sensitive data reviewed for cultural and jurisdictional accuracy. |

Audit records linked to:  
`data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json` and `data/reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json`.
