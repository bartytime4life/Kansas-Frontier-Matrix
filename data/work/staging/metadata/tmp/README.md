# üß© Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Metadata TMP Workspace**
`data/work/staging/metadata/tmp/README.md`

**Purpose:** Temporary workspace for harmonizing, transforming, and cross-validating metadata structures prior to formal validation and governance ledger integration.  
This layer supports FAIR+CARE metadata workflows and ensures all KFM datasets achieve schema interoperability between STAC, DCAT, and PROV-O before certification.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/staging/metadata/tmp/` directory acts as a **metadata sandbox** for crosswalking, merging, and testing dataset descriptors before promotion to the validated staging layer.  
It provides a controlled, ephemeral environment for metadata analysts and governance automation tools to reconcile schema mismatches, repair records, and generate unified metadata outputs.

This workspace supports:
- Conversion between STAC 1.0, DCAT 3.0, and schema.org metadata formats.  
- PROV-O lineage augmentation for dataset traceability.  
- FAIR+CARE ethical metadata pre-validation.  
- Preparation of records for ingestion into governance and STAC systems.  

All files here are **temporary** and are automatically deleted upon successful validation or at the end of each staging session.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Metadata Harmonization Workflow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Incoming Metadata from data/raw/*"] --> B["Crosswalk: STAC ‚Üî DCAT ‚Üî PROV-O"]
    B --> C["Field Harmonization & Schema Merge"]
    C --> D["FAIR and CARE Metadata Audit (Pre-Validation)"]
    D --> E["Validation Reports in data/work/staging/metadata/validation/"]
    E --> F["Promotion to data/work/staging/metadata/"]
```

### Workflow Description:
1. **Crosswalk:** Align field names and ontology relationships across metadata schemas.  
2. **Merge:** Combine schema fields into standardized unified records.  
3. **Audit:** Pre-validate FAIR+CARE ethical metadata requirements (accessibility, provenance, licensing).  
4. **Validate:** Pass results to the formal validation stage (`validation/`).  
5. **Promote:** Certified metadata promoted for governance and STAC integration.

## üß† FAIR+CARE Metadata Preparation Alignment

| Principle | Implementation in TMP Workspace |
|------------|--------------------------------|
| **Findable** | Metadata enriched with unique IDs and STAC/DCAT field mapping. |
| **Accessible** | Stored in open JSON format, accessible to validation workflows. |
| **Interoperable** | Cross-schema harmonization ensures multi-standard compatibility. |
| **Reusable** | Outputs structured for STAC publication and governance reuse. |
| **Collective Benefit** | Supports ethical, discoverable metadata across disciplines. |
| **Authority to Control** | FAIR+CARE Council validates harmonization outcomes. |
| **Responsibility** | Metadata maintainers document schema merges and corrections. |
| **Ethics** | Records reviewed for proper attribution and cultural sensitivity. |

Compliance and audit records integrated with:  
`data/reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json` and `data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json`.
