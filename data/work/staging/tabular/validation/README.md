# ‚úÖ Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Tabular Validation Workspace**
`data/work/staging/tabular/validation/README.md`

**Purpose:** Dedicated workspace for quality assurance, schema compliance, and FAIR+CARE ethics validation of tabular datasets in the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
Ensures all tables meet technical, ethical, and interoperability standards before promotion to normalized or processed layers.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/staging/tabular/validation/` directory serves as the **final validation checkpoint** for all tabular datasets prior to certification.  
This layer verifies schema accuracy, FAIR+CARE compliance, and governance linkage for reproducible tabular data workflows.

### Key Responsibilities:
- Validate tabular data structure against JSON schema and data contracts.  
- Verify field-level data types, value ranges, and categorical consistency.  
- Conduct FAIR+CARE ethics audits for accessibility, attribution, and open-data quality.  
- Cross-check dataset provenance, versioning, and checksum integrity.  

All validation logs and reports are integrated into the KFM provenance ledger for full transparency.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tabular Validation Workflow

    B --> C["FAIR and CARE Ethics Audit"]
    C --> D["Governance Ledger Registration"]
    D --> E["Certification and Promotion to Processed Workspace"]
```

### Workflow Steps:
1. **Schema Validation:** Ensure alignment with the latest `data_contract_ref`.  
2. **Quality Assurance:** Evaluate null values, consistency, and type conformity.  
3. **Ethical Review:** Run FAIR+CARE audits on accessibility, openness, and reuse compliance.  
4. **Governance Registration:** Write validation outcomes to provenance ledger.  
5. **Certification:** Flag datasets as ‚ÄúFAIR+CARE Certified‚Äù before publication.

## üß† FAIR+CARE Compliance Review

| Principle | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Findable** | Indexed in provenance ledger and linked to STAC/DCAT catalog entries. |
| **Accessible** | Stored in open, machine-readable CSV and Parquet formats. |
| **Interoperable** | Schema fields validated against JSON Schema and DCAT specs. |
| **Reusable** | Metadata ensures citation, licensing, and checksum traceability. |
| **Collective Benefit** | Ensures ethical, equitable use of environmental and archival data. |
| **Authority to Control** | FAIR+CARE Council certifies tabular governance compliance. |
| **Responsibility** | Validation reports archived for reproducibility. |
| **Ethics** | All attributes verified for neutrality, privacy, and sensitivity. |

FAIR+CARE results stored in:  
`data/reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json`  
and `data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Validation & QA Tools

| Tool | Function | Output |
|------|-----------|--------|
| **Great Expectations** | Field-level schema and value-range testing. | JSON |
| **Pandas / PyArrow** | Statistical QA and type harmonization. | CSV / Parquet |
| **FAIR+CARE Validator** | Ethical and accessibility scoring. | JSON |
| **stac-validator** | Cross-schema verification with STAC/DCAT. | Text log |
