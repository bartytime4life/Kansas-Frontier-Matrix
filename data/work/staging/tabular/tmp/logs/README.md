# üßæ Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Tabular TMP Logs**
`data/work/staging/tabular/tmp/logs/README.md`

**Purpose:** Centralized log directory for all tabular ingestion, normalization, and FAIR+CARE pre-validation events in the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM) ETL pipeline.  
These logs ensure traceability, transparency, and reproducibility across all temporary tabular processing tasks performed during staging.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/staging/tabular/tmp/logs/` directory captures **runtime activity logs, validation results, and governance synchronization traces** for temporary tabular ETL operations.  
It documents ingestion, schema alignment, pre-validation, and FAIR+CARE ethical review activities prior to dataset normalization.

### Primary Functions:
- Record ETL execution metadata for each TMP operation.  
- Capture schema validation and field normalization diagnostics.  
- Log FAIR+CARE ethical checks and audit communications.  
- Maintain provenance synchronization logs for checksum verification.  

All logs comply with FAIR+CARE governance standards and are retained for audit reproducibility.

## ‚öôÔ∏è TMP Logging Workflow

    A["Raw Tabular Data (data/raw/*)"] --> B["ETL Intake & Schema Mapping"]
    B --> C["Validation & FAIR+CARE Pre-Audit"]
    C --> D["Write Logs to data/work/staging/tabular/tmp/logs/"]
    D --> E["Sync Governance Ledger and Checksum Manifest"]
```

### Workflow Description:
1. **ETL Intake:** Logs created during ingestion and schema normalization.  
2. **Validation:** Field-level QA, encoding, and data type checks recorded.  
3. **Ethics Review:** FAIR+CARE pre-audit results appended to log metadata.  
4. **Governance:** Checksum and provenance entries written to audit ledger.  
5. **Synchronization:** Log hashes added to `releases/v9.3.2/manifest.zip`.

## üß† FAIR+CARE Compliance in TMP Logging

| Principle | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Findable** | Each TMP log indexed by dataset, ETL pipeline, and checksum ID. |
| **Accessible** | Logs stored in open text or JSON formats for governance access. |
| **Interoperable** | Schema aligned with FAIR+CARE and MCP-DL logging standards. |
| **Reusable** | Logs include provenance and checksum references for reproducibility. |
| **Collective Benefit** | Promotes ethical transparency in staging pipelines. |
| **Authority to Control** | FAIR+CARE Council monitors pre-validation audit results. |
| **Responsibility** | Validators and engineers must document all TMP transformations. |
| **Ethics** | Logs redact sensitive or personal identifiers before archival. |

FAIR+CARE compliance results synchronized to:  
`data/reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json` and `data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json`.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Log Categories

| Log File | Description | Format |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| `etl_tmp_run.log` | Execution trace of tabular ETL TMP pipelines. | Text |
| `data_contract_check.log` | Field-level and schema compliance trace. | Text |
| `faircare_pre_audit.log` | FAIR+CARE ethical pre-validation results. | Text |
| `governance_sync.log` | Governance ledger and manifest synchronization record. | Text |
| `metadata.json` | Contextual metadata and checksum validation. | JSON |

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Governance & Provenance Integration

| Record | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `metadata.json` | Captures TMP run identifiers, provenance linkage, and checksums. |
| `data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json` | Logs TMP lineage, ETL run status, and audit trace. |
| `data/reports/validation/schema_validation_summary.json` | Contains validation conformance outcomes. |
| `releases/v9.3.2/manifest.zip` | Tracks log integrity through SHA-256 checksum records. |

Governance synchronization automated by `tabular_tmp_log_sync.yml`.

---

## üßæ Retention Policy

| Log Type | Retention Duration | Policy |
|-----------|--------------------|--------|
| ETL TMP Logs | 30 days | Purged after dataset normalization approval. |
| Schema Validation Logs | 14 days | Retained for review, then archived to system logs. |
| FAIR+CARE Pre-Audit Logs | 90 days | Maintained for ethics re-audit verification. |
| Governance Sync Logs | 365 days | Archived for governance continuity. |

Automated cleanup handled by `tabular_tmp_cleanup.yml`.
