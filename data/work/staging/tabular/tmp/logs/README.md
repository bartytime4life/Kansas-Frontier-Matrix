# 📜 Kansas Frontier Matrix — **System Logs**  
`data/work/staging/tabular/tmp/logs/`

### *“Every transformation, every validation, every byte — logged, verified, and remembered.”*

**Purpose:**  
The **System Logs Layer** captures all **ETL, validation, normalization, and AI governance events** occurring within the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM) staging environment.  
It provides a **complete operational trace** ensuring that all automated and human actions are **auditable, reversible, and ethically documented** under FAIR+CARE principles.

## 🧭 Overview

The **System Logs Layer** ensures that every component in the KFM data pipeline — from raw ingestion to AI validation — leaves an immutable, timestamped trail.  
It unifies logs from:
- ETL pipelines and extraction events  
- AI and FAIR+CARE validation processes  
- Schema normalization and conflict resolution operations  
- Audit sandbox simulations  
- Governance synchronization and checksum verification  

All log entries are **signed, versioned, and checksum-validated** to maintain operational integrity and reproducibility.

## 🧩 Logs Manifest Schema

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| `log_id` | Unique log entry ID | `log_2025_10_26_0057` |
| `process` | System process name | `ETL / Validation / AI / Audit / Governance` |
| `file_path` | Location of log file | `validation_engine.log` |
| `record_count` | Number of entries logged | `1289` |
| `checksum` | SHA-256 integrity hash | `f9a7c18b4e98efb...` |
| `curator_reviewed` | Whether curator has audited log | `true` |
| `timestamp` | Time of last update | `2025-10-26T17:24:09Z` |
| `governance_link` | Ledger reference | `governance/system_logs_ledger.jsonld#log_2025_10_26_0057` |

## ⚙️ Core Components

| Component | Function | Output |
|------------|-----------|---------|
| **ETL Pipeline Logger** | Captures data extraction and transformation events | `etl_pipeline.log` |
| **Validation Engine Logger** | Records schema, FAIR+CARE, and checksum tests | `validation_engine.log` |
| **Normalization Trace Recorder** | Logs harmonization and semantic realignments | `normalization_engine.log` |
| **AI Process Logger** | Tracks inference runs, confidence scores, and drift alerts | `ai_processing.log` |
| **Audit Sandbox Logger** | Documents governance simulation events | `audit_pipeline.log` |
| **Governance Sync Tracker** | Logs synchronization and ledger updates | `governance_sync.log` |
| **Integrity Verifier** | Validates all logs with cryptographic checksums | `integrity_verification.log` |

> 🧠 *If transparency is the soul of science, logs are its memory — immutable, structured, and ethical.*

## ⚙️ Curator & Operations Workflow

1. Review recent ETL and validation logs:
   ```bash
   tail -n 50 etl_pipeline.log
   tail -n 50 validation_engine.log
   ```
2. Generate integrity verification report:
   ```bash
   make logs-verify
   ```
3. Archive completed logs and refresh manifest:
   ```bash
   make logs-archive
   ```
4. Sync log metadata to governance ledger:
   ```bash
   make governance-update
   ```
