# ⚖️ Kansas Frontier Matrix — **Conflict Resolution**  
`data/work/staging/tabular/tmp/conflict_resolution/`

### *“Truth in data is rarely singular — resolution is how we make it shared.”*

**Purpose:**  
The **Conflict Resolution Layer** manages **semantic, structural, and provenance discrepancies** detected after normalization in the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
It ensures that data inconsistencies — whether across temporal records, sources, or schemas — are **identified, adjudicated, and documented** transparently under FAIR+CARE governance.

## 🧭 Overview

The **Conflict Resolution Layer** acts as KFM’s **data arbitration environment** — the ethical and technical buffer where contradictory or overlapping information is resolved through documented governance workflows.  
Conflicts may arise from:
- Duplicate or inconsistent records between sources  
- Schema field mismatches after normalization  
- AI or human disagreement in classification outcomes  
- Divergent temporal or spatial metadata alignment  

This layer enables KFM to achieve **consensus-driven truth** through **traceable, explainable, and auditable reconciliation logic**.

## 🧩 Conflict Manifest Schema

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| `conflict_id` | Unique identifier for conflict case | `conflict_2025_10_26_014` |
| `dataset_id` | Dataset(s) involved in conflict | `ks_treaty_records_1851` |
| `conflict_type` | Nature of conflict | `Field Mismatch / Temporal Discrepancy / Provenance Divergence` |
| `ai_recommendation` | AI-suggested resolution | `"Retain value from source with highest confidence weight (0.97)."` |
| `human_decision` | Curator or governance resolution | `"Merged sources A+B with averaged confidence; documented reasoning in notes."` |
| `resolution_confidence` | Final consensus confidence | `0.945` |
| `timestamp` | UTC time of conflict resolution | `2025-10-26T17:00:28Z` |
| `governance_ref` | Ledger provenance link | `governance/conflict_resolution_ledger.jsonld#conflict_2025_10_26_014` |

## ⚙️ Core Components

| Component | Function | Output |
|------------|-----------|---------|
| **Conflict Detector** | Identifies inconsistencies between normalized datasets | `detected_conflicts.json` |
| **AI Resolution Engine** | Suggests reconciliation paths using probabilistic reasoning | `ai_conflict_analysis.json` |
| **Human Oversight Module** | Records curator decisions and governance approvals | `human_resolution_notes.json` |
| **Rule Hierarchy System** | Defines deterministic resolution logic for recurring cases | `reconciliation_rules.yaml` |
| **Provenance Integrator** | Logs conflict outcomes and decisions in governance records | `conflict_manifest.json` |

> 🧠 *Resolution does not erase disagreement — it transforms uncertainty into accountable consensus.*

## ⚙️ Curator & Governance Workflow

1. Review detected discrepancies listed in `detected_conflicts.json`.  
2. Evaluate AI suggestions in `ai_conflict_analysis.json`.  
3. Apply or override recommendations using `human_resolution_notes.json`.  
4. Document reconciliation logic and reasoning under `reconciliation_rules.yaml`.  
5. Finalize merged results into `merged_resolutions.json`.  
6. Update governance ledger for traceability:
   ```bash
   make governance-update
   ```
