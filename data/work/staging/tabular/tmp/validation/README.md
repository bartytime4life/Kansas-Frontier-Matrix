# ‚úÖ Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Tabular Validation TMP Workspace**
`data/work/staging/tabular/tmp/validation/README.md`

**Purpose:** Temporary validation workspace for schema testing, quality checks, and FAIR+CARE pre-audits of tabular datasets during the ETL staging process.  
Ensures CSV, JSON, and Parquet tables conform to schema definitions, ethical governance principles, and FAIR+CARE data standards before promotion to validated staging layers.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/staging/tabular/tmp/validation/` directory contains **transient validation artifacts** used during the ETL staging process for tabular datasets.  
These validation steps ensure that all tabular data adheres to defined data contracts, JSON Schemas, and FAIR+CARE ethical principles before migration into normalized staging.

### Functions:
- Validate schema structure against `data_contract_ref`.  
- Perform column-level and datatype integrity checks.  
- Run FAIR+CARE ethical pre-audits for accessibility and attribution.  
- Log QA metrics, errors, and governance synchronization results.  

All validation artifacts in this directory are **temporary** and purged after successful staging or audit confirmation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tabular Validation Workflow

```mermaid

    A["Ingested Tabular Data (data/work/staging/tabular/tmp/intake/)"] --> B["Schema and Data Type Validation"]
    B --> C["FAIR and CARE Ethics Pre-Audit"]
    C --> D["Generate QA Summaries and Logs"]
    D --> E["Governance Sync and Ledger Registration"]
```

### Workflow Description:
1. **Schema Validation:** Check field presence, naming conventions, and data types.  
2. **Ethics Audit:** Run FAIR+CARE tests on accessibility, documentation, and provenance.  
3. **QA Summary:** Generate structured logs and error reports for review.  
4. **Governance:** Register results with provenance ledger and manifest.  
5. **Promotion:** Clean datasets advanced to `data/work/staging/tabular/normalized/`.

## üß† FAIR+CARE Pre-Audit Compliance

| Principle | Implementation in TMP Validation |
|------------|---------------------------------|
| **Findable** | All temporary validation records include schema ID and checksum. |
| **Accessible** | Validation reports available internally to FAIR+CARE Council. |
| **Interoperable** | Validation outputs follow open JSON and CSV QA standards. |
| **Reusable** | Metadata and audit logs preserve validation lineage. |
| **Collective Benefit** | Ensures ethical stewardship before public release. |
| **Authority to Control** | Governance Council verifies schema and ethics results. |
| **Responsibility** | Validators record schema and ethical outcomes in audit ledger. |
| **Ethics** | Reviews dataset structure for restricted or inappropriate content. |

Audit reports appended to:  
`data/reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json`  
and `data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json`.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Validation Artifacts

| File | Description | Format |
|------|--------------|--------|
| `schema_preview.json` | Preview of schema mapping, fields, and datatypes. | JSON |
| `field_normalization_summary.json` | Field renaming and normalization report. | JSON |
| `faircare_pre_audit.json` | FAIR+CARE ethics compliance pre-audit results. | JSON |
| `schema_error_log.txt` | Detailed error trace from schema conformance check. | Text |
| `metadata.json` | Runtime context, checksum, and provenance linkage. | JSON |

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Governance & Provenance Integration

| Record | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `metadata.json` | Captures validation runtime, validator identity, and checksum reference. |
| `data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json` | Logs validation lineage and FAIR+CARE pre-audit results. |
| `data/reports/validation/schema_validation_summary.json` | Stores cross-schema validation outcomes. |
| `releases/v9.3.2/manifest.zip` | Global checksum record of validated TMP files. |

Governance synchronization automated via `tabular_validation_sync.yml`.

---

## üßæ Retention Policy

| File Type | Retention Duration | Policy |
|------------|--------------------|--------|
| Schema Reports | 14 days | Deleted after staging validation success. |
| FAIR+CARE Audits | 30 days | Retained for governance review. |
| Error Logs | 7 days | Purged post-resolution and ledger entry. |
| Metadata | 365 days | Archived for provenance and certification continuity. |

Cleanup governed by `tabular_tmp_cleanup.yml`.
