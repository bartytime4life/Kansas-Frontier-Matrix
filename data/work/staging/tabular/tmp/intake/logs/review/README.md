# 🧑‍💼 Kansas Frontier Matrix — **Tabular Intake Review Logs**  
`data/work/staging/tabular/tmp/intake/logs/review/`

### *“Human judgment is the final checkpoint before truth enters the Matrix.”*

**Purpose:**  
The **Review Logs Directory** houses manual curation, verification, and approval records for tabular datasets during the **Intake TMP validation process**.  
Each entry documents human curator actions—review decisions, anomaly resolutions, FAIR+CARE sign-offs, and final dataset acceptance or rejection.

## 🧭 Overview

**Review Logs** represent the human layer of accountability in the data intake pipeline.  
While automated validation and AI checks ensure precision and consistency, curator review ensures **contextual integrity, ethical soundness, and semantic accuracy**.

Every dataset promoted to the normalized layer must have a corresponding **signed-off review log** located here.

Review logs serve multiple purposes:
- Record human decisions on AI anomaly flags and FAIR+CARE compliance.  
- Document rationale for overrides or quarantines.  
- Provide timestamped, attributable signatures for governance and reproducibility.  
- Act as human-verifiable audit trails linked to provenance ledger entries.

## 🧱 Log Format

Review logs are in **plaintext Markdown-style** for human readability, but can be parsed programmatically.
Each log captures curator identity, timestamp, decision, confidence, and supporting notes.

## 🧩 Review Decision Codes

| Code                       | Meaning                  | Description                                                    |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ **ACCEPTED**             | Fully validated dataset  | Meets schema, checksum, and FAIR+CARE requirements.            |
| ⚠️ **APPROVED-WITH-NOTES** | Minor issues noted       | Small inconsistencies documented but acceptable for promotion. |
| 🚧 **REVIEW-NEEDED**       | Pending curator check    | Flagged for secondary review before approval.                  |
| ⛔ **REJECTED**             | Failed or unethical data | Violates schema, licensing, or ethical standards.              |
| 🧯 **ROLLED-BACK**         | Reverted post-promotion  | Dataset removed from normalized layer due to discovered issue. |

## 🧠 Review Guidelines

| Step | Action                                   | Responsible    | Tool                                   |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣  | Verify schema & checksum validation      | Data Engineer  | `make validate-tabular`                |
| 2️⃣  | Review AI anomaly and confidence metrics | Curator        | `logs/ai/ai-anomalies-*.jsonl`         |
| 3️⃣  | Confirm FAIR+CARE compliance             | Ethics Officer | `logs/faircare/faircare-audit-*.jsonl` |
| 4️⃣  | Record review decision and rationale     | Curator        | `make review-approve`                  |
| 5️⃣  | Append decision to governance ledger     | Automation     | Ledger sync job                        |

> 🧩 *All manual reviews must reference linked log files and be timestamped to ensure reproducibility.*

## 🧾 Governance Integration

Once signed and committed, review logs are appended to the **Governance Ledger** for traceability:

```json
{
  "dataset": "ks_hydro_1874",
  "review_log": "logs/review/review-ks_hydro_1874.log",
  "decision": "ACCEPTED",
  "reviewer": "@kfm-curation",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-26T14:08:33Z",
  "linked_reports": [
    "logs/validation/validate-ks_hydro_1874.jsonl",
    "logs/ai/ai-anomalies-ks_hydro_1874.jsonl",
    "logs/faircare/faircare-audit-ks_hydro_1874.jsonl"
  ],
  "status": "approved"
}
```

## 🧯 Troubleshooting

| Issue                  | Cause                                   | Resolution                                       |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Missing review log** | Curator not assigned or skipped review  | Run `make review-init` to generate template      |
| **Ledger mismatch**    | Review not synced to ledger             | Run `make sync-ledger`                           |
| **Duplicate decision** | Multiple curators reviewed same dataset | Merge entries manually or mark one as superseded |
| **Audit discrepancy**  | FAIR+CARE score disagreement            | Escalate to governance council                   |
