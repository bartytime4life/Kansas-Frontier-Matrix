# 🚨 Kansas Frontier Matrix — **Intake Quarantine**  
`data/work/staging/tabular/tmp/intake/quarantine/`

### *“Every error has a home until it’s understood, documented, and fixed.”*

**Purpose:**  
This directory functions as the **primary containment zone** for datasets that fail validation during tabular intake into the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
It centralizes all **non-conforming, incomplete, or anomalous tabular data** flagged by schema, checksum, FAIR+CARE, and AI-based validation systems.  
All quarantined datasets remain isolated, versioned, and traceable until successfully remediated and revalidated.

## 🧭 Overview

The **Intake Quarantine Layer** provides a structured, auditable environment for containing and managing datasets that do not meet KFM’s rigorous validation standards.  
It ensures that data issues are never lost or ignored — they are systematically tracked, explained, and corrected.  

Each dataset in quarantine:
- Is stored with complete metadata and provenance.  
- Has a linked entry in the **Governance Ledger** for accountability.  
- Is classified under one or more error categories (schema, checksum, FAIR+CARE, AI anomaly, etc.).  
- Is reviewed by both **automated remediation agents** and **human curators**.  

Quarantine ensures integrity of the KFM ecosystem while maintaining traceability and ethical handling of all data artifacts.

## ⚙️ Curator Workflow

Curators and data governance officers should:

1. Review quarantine directories daily for new datasets or unresolved issues.
2. Prioritize remediation based on severity and dataset importance.
3. Use AI-suggested fixes documented in `remediation_logs/` as guidance.
4. Validate remediations by running:

   ```bash
   make revalidate-flagged
   ```
5. Upon successful verification, promote the dataset to its corresponding normalized or processed directory.
6. Record closure notes in governance ledger and update FAIR+CARE status.
