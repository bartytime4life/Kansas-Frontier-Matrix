# üìä Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Tabular Normalized Workspace**
`data/work/staging/tabular/normalized/README.md`

**Purpose:** Repository for schema-aligned, FAIR+CARE-audited tabular datasets that have passed intake and validation in the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM) ETL pipeline.  
This layer contains cleaned, deduplicated, and governance-certified data ready for promotion to processed layers or public release.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/staging/tabular/normalized/` directory stores **normalized and schema-conformant tabular datasets** produced by KFM‚Äôs data pipelines.  
These files represent datasets that have passed intake, preliminary validation, and FAIR+CARE ethics audits ‚Äî fully harmonized for interoperability and reuse.

### Key Functions:
- Store FAIR+CARE-compliant, schema-aligned tabular data outputs.  
- Ensure each file matches the latest data contract and schema version.  
- Maintain provenance and checksum traceability for reproducibility.  
- Serve as the input for processed, archival, and analytic data layers.  

All normalized datasets include embedded metadata and governance logs for open-science verification.

    C --> D["FAIR+CARE Certification and Ethics Verification"]
    D --> E["Export Normalized Tables to CSV / Parquet"]
    E --> F["Register Metadata and Checksum in Governance Ledger"]
```

### Workflow Description:
1. **Schema Harmonization:** Fields renamed and reordered according to data contract.  
2. **Normalization:** Encoding, null values, and categorical standardization enforced.  
3. **Ethics Audit:** FAIR+CARE Council verification of accessible and ethical data handling.  
4. **Output Generation:** Datasets stored in open formats with governance metadata.  
5. **Governance:** Lineage entries recorded in `data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json`.
