# üß© Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **TMP Conflict Resolution Layer (Data Merge & Schema Arbitration)**  
`data/work/staging/tabular/normalized/tmp/conflict_resolution/README.md`

**Purpose:** Provide a controlled workspace for **detecting, logging, and resolving data conflicts** during the normalization and validation processes within the **Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM)** system.  
This directory ensures that competing ETL outputs, schema mismatches, or provenance discrepancies are handled deterministically and transparently under FAIR+CARE and MCP-DL governance.

## üß≠ Overview

The **Conflict Resolution Layer** serves as a **sandboxed arbitration zone** for resolving discrepancies across:
- ETL pipeline outputs (`normalization_buffer/`)
- Schema validations (`validation_scratch/schema_reports/`)
- Provenance assemblies (`provenance_staging/`)

This ensures data promoted to `data/work/staging/tabular/normalized/treaties/` is **consistent, harmonized, and fully auditable**.  
Conflicts can include:
- Duplicate entries from concurrent ETL runs  
- Divergent schema definitions between validation batches  
- Overlapping temporal or spatial extents  
- Conflicting provenance or author attribution  

All resolutions are documented with **machine-verified diffs** and **human-reviewed notes** for long-term reproducibility.

[2025-10-25 12:30Z] Reviewer: @kfm-validation  
Comment: The provenance conflict for KS_TREATY_1853_01_KAW was resolved after reprocessing using normalize_treaty_v6.3.  
Checksum confirmed and consistent with archived records.  
Ethics review required only for AI-attribution clarification.

## üìä QA Metrics Summary

| Metric | Description | Target | Source |
|--------|--------------|---------|--------|
| Schema Conflict Resolution Rate | % of schema mismatches resolved automatically | ‚â• 90% | schema_conflicts.json |
| Provenance Alignment Rate | % of lineage corrections passing validation | ‚â• 95% | provenance_conflicts.json |
| Governance Escalation Rate | % of unresolved conflicts requiring council input | ‚â§ 10% | merge_decisions.json |
| Data Integrity Verification | Files rechecked via SHA-256 before merge | 100% | conflict_index.json |
| FAIR+CARE Compliance | Ethical and open-data validation during merge | ‚â• 95% | audit_manifest.json |

## üîí Governance & Provenance Integration

All resolutions and merges generate:
- A **prov:Activity** log in `/tmp/provenance_staging/activities/merge_resolution.jsonld`
- A **ledger record** in `/governance/ledger/validation/YYYY/MM/conflict_resolution.jsonld`
- A **checksum verification entry** in `/checksums/archive/treaties_2025_Q4.sha256`

### Example Governance Ledger Entry

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/prov#",
  "@id": "urn:kfm:activity:conflict_resolution:2025-10-25",
  "prov:wasGeneratedBy": "merge_resolution_pipeline_v2.0",
  "prov:wasAttributedTo": "@kfm-validation",
  "prov:used": [
    "conflict_resolution/conflict_index.json",
    "conflict_resolution/merge_decisions.json"
  ],
  "prov:value": "TMP conflict successfully resolved and merged into normalized dataset.",
  "prov:generatedAtTime": "2025-10-25T12:45:00Z"
}
