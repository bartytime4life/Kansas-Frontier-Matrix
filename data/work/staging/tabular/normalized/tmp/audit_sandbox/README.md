# üßæ Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **TMP Audit Sandbox (Validation Review & Governance QA Zone)**  
`data/work/staging/tabular/normalized/tmp/audit_sandbox/README.md`

**Purpose:** Provide an isolated **sandbox environment for governance review, ethics auditing, and validation re-checks** during the ETL normalization process in the **Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM)**.  
This layer supports **human-in-the-loop quality assurance**, allowing governance, validation, and ethics teams to manually verify data quality, schema accuracy, and provenance traceability before final ledger publication.

## üß≠ Overview

The **Audit Sandbox** is the **human oversight layer** of TMP, enabling structured review and approval of:
- Validation results (`validation_scratch/`)
- Provenance and schema logs (`provenance_staging/`)
- Ethical compliance checks (`audit_flags/`)

All artifacts entering this sandbox must:
1. Pass preliminary validation and integrity checks.
2. Include provenance links (`prov:wasGeneratedBy`, `prov:wasAttributedTo`).
3. Be **re-reviewable** by governance and ethics teams prior to merge or ledger registration.

This environment ensures that **no automated decision** promotes data without human verification ‚Äî a cornerstone of MCP-DL reproducibility and CARE-compliant transparency.

## üìä Audit QA Metrics

| Metric | Description | Target | Source |
|--------|--------------|---------|---------|
| Governance Review Coverage | % of TMP datasets reviewed by governance | 100% | governance_review_log.json |
| Ethics Compliance Rate | % of records passing FAIR+CARE review | ‚â• 95% | ethics_review_notes.txt |
| QA Discrepancy Resolution | % of audit diffs resolved | ‚â• 98% | validation_audit_diff.json |

## üîí Governance & Provenance Integration

All audit outcomes are:
- Logged as `prov:Activity` records under `/governance/ledger/validation/YYYY/MM/audit_sandbox.jsonld`
- Cross-linked with provenance in `/tmp/provenance_staging/activities/review_audit_process.jsonld`
- Integrated with CI/CD workflows `audit-review.yml` and `ethics-validate.yml`

### Example Governance Ledger Entry

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/prov#",
  "@id": "urn:kfm:audit:review:2025-10-25",
  "prov:wasGeneratedBy": "audit_sandbox_v2.0",
  "prov:wasAttributedTo": "@kfm-governance",
  "prov:used": [
    "audit_sandbox/qa_rechecks.json",
    "audit_sandbox/ethics_review_notes.txt"
  ],
  "prov:value": "Human-reviewed TMP dataset audit completed under CARE ethical standards.",
  "prov:generatedAtTime": "2025-10-25T16:00:00Z"
}
