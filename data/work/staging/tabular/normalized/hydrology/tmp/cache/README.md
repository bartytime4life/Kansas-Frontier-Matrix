# üíæ Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Hydrology TMP Cache (Preprocessed Data & Lookup Assets)**  
`data/work/staging/tabular/normalized/hydrology/tmp/cache/README.md`

**Purpose:** Serve as the **temporary hydrological data cache** for preprocessed, cleaned, and geospatially aligned datasets prior to full ETL normalization.  
This layer accelerates repetitive hydrology workflows ‚Äî e.g., streamflow extraction, aquifer depth interpolation, rainfall raster resampling ‚Äî within the **Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM)** ETL environment.

## üß≠ Overview

The **TMP Cache Layer** acts as an **accelerator and consistency buffer** for hydrology ETL workflows.  
It minimizes redundant computation by storing cleaned, formatted, and cross-referenced hydrological datasets between ETL runs.

### Objectives
- Enable **fast reloads** of intermediate hydrology data for iterative processing.  
- Maintain **geospatial consistency** across all temporary datasets (EPSG:4326 baseline).  
- Ensure **checksum-verified integrity** before reuse.  
- Support **FAIR data principles** ‚Äî cached data are fully traceable and documented.  

This cache is automatically rebuilt **every 24 hours** or whenever raw hydrology sources (USGS, NOAA, KGS) update.
