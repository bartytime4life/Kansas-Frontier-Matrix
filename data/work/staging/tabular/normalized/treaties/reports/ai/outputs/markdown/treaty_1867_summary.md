## 📜 Overview

The **Medicine Lodge Treaty of 1867** represents a pivotal agreement between the **U.S. Government** and several Plains Indigenous Nations, including the **Kiowa**, **Comanche**, **Apache**, **Arapaho**, and **Cheyenne**.  
Signed near **Medicine Lodge Creek** in present-day Kansas, this treaty sought to transition Indigenous Nations from nomadic livelihoods toward reservation-based settlements, under the pretext of “civilization” and peacebuilding.

The treaty codified the **reservation system** in the Southern Plains and formalized education, land use, and annuity clauses—ushering in a new era of cultural disruption and dependency under federal policy.

## 🪶 Indigenous Perspective and Impact

The Medicine Lodge negotiations were conducted under **unequal power dynamics** and persistent threats of military enforcement.  
Although framed as a peace accord, the treaty facilitated **systematic dispossession** and coercive assimilation.

Key provisions included:
- Relocation of tribal nations to designated reservations.  
- Prohibition of independent hunting beyond reservation borders.  
- Forced schooling and missionary education programs.  
- Reliance on U.S.-issued annuities for sustenance and survival.

> ⚖️ *The treaty exemplifies the paradox of “peace through confinement,” transforming Indigenous sovereignty into conditional compliance.*
