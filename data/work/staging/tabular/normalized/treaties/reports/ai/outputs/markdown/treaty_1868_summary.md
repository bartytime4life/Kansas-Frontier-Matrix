## üìú Overview

The **Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)** was signed between the **United States Government** and the **Oglala Lakota (Sioux)**, along with allied tribes including the **Miniconjou**, **Brul√©**, **Arapaho**, and **Cheyenne**.  
Negotiated in **April 1868** at **Fort Laramie, Wyoming Territory**, the treaty established the **Great Sioux Reservation**, granting the Black Hills and surrounding lands to the Lakota people.

This agreement aimed to end armed conflict following **Red Cloud‚Äôs War (1866‚Äì1868)** but was later violated after gold was discovered in the Black Hills (1874), leading to renewed wars and eventual U.S. annexation of treaty lands.

## ü™∂ Indigenous Significance

The treaty represents one of the most significant legal acknowledgments of **Lakota sovereignty** and territorial rights.  
It prohibited unauthorized settlers and military presence within the Great Sioux Reservation and affirmed Indigenous governance over internal affairs.

However, the **subsequent U.S. violations** ‚Äî particularly the Black Hills invasion ‚Äî remain central to ongoing land restitution claims by the **Oglala Lakota Nation** and affiliated tribes.

**Key Indigenous Leaders:**
- Chief **Red Cloud (Ma»üp√≠ya L√∫ta)** ‚Äî Oglala Lakota  
- Chief **Spotted Tail (Si≈ãt√© Gle≈°k√°)** ‚Äî Brul√© Lakota  
- Chief **Man Afraid of His Horses (T»üat»ü√≥ka √çyotake)** ‚Äî Oglala Lakota
