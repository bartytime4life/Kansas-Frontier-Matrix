## üß≠ Overview

The **Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)** marked one of the most consequential diplomatic agreements between the United States and Indigenous Nations of the Great Plains.  
Signed in the aftermath of **Red Cloud‚Äôs War (1866‚Äì1868)**, the treaty sought to end hostilities and recognize **Lakota sovereignty** over the **Great Sioux Reservation**, which included the sacred Black Hills.

Despite its promises, the treaty‚Äôs terms were quickly undermined by U.S. expansionist interests, particularly after gold was discovered in the Black Hills in 1874, leading to renewed conflict and long-lasting land disputes that persist to this day.

## üß¨ Historical Significance

The **Fort Laramie Treaty** stands as a cornerstone in both U.S. and Indigenous history, representing the height of negotiated peace followed by its systematic erosion.  
It remains legally significant due to the **1980 U.S. Supreme Court ruling** (*United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians*) affirming that the Black Hills were unlawfully taken from the Lakota in violation of this treaty.

> ü™∂ *‚ÄúThe right to the Black Hills has never been extinguished ‚Äî it was only broken by greed.‚Äù ‚Äî Lakota Oral Tradition*
