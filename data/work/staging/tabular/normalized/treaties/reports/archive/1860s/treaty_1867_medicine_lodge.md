## üß≠ Overview

The **Medicine Lodge Treaty (1867)** was a series of agreements signed between the U.S. Government and several Plains Nations, aiming to end hostilities and confine Indigenous populations to federally managed reservations.  
Negotiated near **Medicine Lodge Creek** in southern Kansas, the treaty institutionalized the **reservation system** and marked the beginning of a new era of displacement, dependency, and cultural suppression.

While presented as a peace accord, the treaty was coercive in nature‚Äîimposing restrictions on hunting, sovereignty, and mobility in exchange for U.S. protection and economic subsidies.

## üß¨ Historical Context

The **Medicine Lodge Treaty** attempted to institutionalize ‚Äúpeace through confinement,‚Äù forcing Indigenous Nations onto fixed reservations and mandating agricultural lifestyles.  
Though intended to prevent further conflict, the U.S. consistently violated the treaty‚Äôs terms within a few years, seizing additional lands and reducing annuities.
