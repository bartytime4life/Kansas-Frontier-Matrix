## 🧭 Overview

The **Kansas–Nebraska Treaty (1854)** — formally enacted as part of the **Kansas–Nebraska Act** — restructured the political boundaries of the central Great Plains.  
It established two new U.S. territories, **Kansas** and **Nebraska**, and allowed their settlers to determine the legality of slavery under the principle of **popular sovereignty**.  
This policy overturned the Missouri Compromise of 1820 and ignited a violent regional conflict that came to be known as **“Bleeding Kansas.”**

---

## 🪶 Indigenous Context

The treaty facilitated westward expansion at the direct expense of several Indigenous nations.  
Among those most affected were:
- **Kanza (Kaw) Nation** — experienced significant land loss and displacement  
- **Otoe-Missouria Nation** — forced into cession agreements in exchange for federal annuities  
- **Osage Nation** — faced boundary erosion and increasing federal pressure  

These displacements represented the early stages of the broader **Reservation Era**, with Indigenous autonomy replaced by federal management policies.

## 🧭 Historical Significance

The treaty redefined **westward expansion policy**, establishing a precedent for:
- Local governance through **popular sovereignty**  
- Federal disregard for established territorial treaties  
- The escalation of pre–Civil War sectional tensions  

This act divided the nation politically and morally, hastening the polarization that led to the **U.S. Civil War (1861–1865)**.
