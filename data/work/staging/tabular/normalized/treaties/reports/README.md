# 📜 Kansas Frontier Matrix — **Treaty Validation & Audit Reports (Diamond⁹ Ω+++ Governance-AI Historical Validation Parity Final)**  
`data/work/staging/tabular/normalized/treaties/reports/`

**Mission:** Record and preserve all **validation, audit, and AI explainability outputs**  
for treaty and land-cession datasets — verifying their **semantic accuracy**, **ethical governance**,  
and **blockchain-anchored reproducibility** within the **Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM)** FAIR+CARE+ISO+AI system.

## 🧭 Overview

The **Treaty Validation & Reports Layer** documents every quality, ethics, and reproducibility assessment  
performed on Kansas treaty data. Reports are generated automatically during CI/CD execution,  
co-signed by human reviewers, verified by AI models, and sealed through **dual blockchain anchoring**.

> *“Verification is a modern ceremony of respect — a promise that each treaty record is faithfully preserved.”*

## 🧱 Ethical & Historical Stewardship

- **Transparency:** Every validation and AI audit report includes lineage metadata, checksum link, and ledger reference.  
- **Respect:** FAIR+CARE+SOV principles guide how data and reports are reviewed and contextualized.  
- **Stewardship:** Co-authorship between KFM teams and tribal data councils ensures reciprocal governance.  
- **Accountability:** Reports are immutable, cryptographically verifiable, and auditable under MCP-DL v6.3.

---

## 🧠 Historical & Ethical Philosophy

> **Philosophy:**  
> Validation reports are more than documentation — they are reconciliation records.  
> Each verified checksum, each AI-audited field is a quiet affirmation that Kansas’s  
> treaties are preserved with integrity, transparency, and shared responsibility.
