# 🧾 Kansas Frontier Matrix — **AI Treaty Log Archive (2024)**  
`data/work/staging/tabular/normalized/treaties/logs/ai/archive/2024/`

**Purpose:** Immutable, FAIR+CARE-compliant archival of all AI treaty-processing pipeline logs, provenance data, and validation artifacts generated during 2024.  
**Scope:** AI summaries, validation chains, reviewer prompts, model metadata, and governance-linked reports.

## 🧭 Overview

This directory contains **AI-generated and human-validated treaty-processing logs** created by the KFM pipeline throughout **2024**.  
Each record represents a full AI inference cycle — including summarization, validation, ethical review, and ledger integration — for the **treaty normalization subsystem** within the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  

These artifacts are finalized, locked, and compliant with MCP-DL v6.3 documentation standards. The purpose of this archive is to guarantee reproducibility, accountability, and long-term traceability of AI behavior and outputs across all treaty-related processes during 2024.

## 🧩 Purpose and Objectives

### 🎯 Goals

1. **Provenance & Traceability:** Capture a complete digital footprint for each AI pipeline run, including parameters, model versions, and inputs/outputs.
2. **Governance Integration:** Synchronize archival records with FAIR + CARE governance protocols and ethics reviews.
3. **Accountability:** Preserve immutable evidence of AI contributions to treaty summarization and validation workflows.
4. **Auditable Metadata:** Maintain structured metadata for oversight and compliance verification.

## 🔍 How to Use This Archive

### For Developers

* Access individual run logs by timestamp.
* Use `ai_archive_manifest.json` for quick dataset indexing.
* Cross-reference provenance graphs with the **2024 Governance Ledger** under:
  `data/work/staging/tabular/normalized/treaties/reports/ai/outputs/provenance/2024/`.

### For Auditors / FAIR+CARE Council

* Review `validation_report-*.json` and compare to `provenance_chain-*.json` to ensure model integrity.
* Confirm that **token usage, drift, and latency metrics** fall within accepted thresholds.
* Verify that AI models used were those authorized under the 2024 governance policy.

### For Researchers

* Use performance CSVs to analyze longitudinal model behavior (e.g., drift or bias across treaty data).
* Leverage provenance metadata to reconstruct AI reasoning paths or validate reported summaries.

## 🧾 Governance & Integrity

All logs within this directory are considered **immutable** after archival.
Any modification must follow official redaction protocol:

1. Create a new file `redaction_notice-YYYY-MM-DD.json`.
2. Include: affected file name(s), correction rationale, approver credentials, and governance signature.
3. Append to the **2024 AI Governance Ledger**.
4. Never delete or overwrite archived logs.

Redactions are visible and auditable to preserve historical accuracy and transparency.
