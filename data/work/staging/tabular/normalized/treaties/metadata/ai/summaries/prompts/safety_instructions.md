# üõ°Ô∏è Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **AI Safety & Ethical Instructions for Treaty Summarization**  
`data/work/staging/tabular/normalized/treaties/metadata/ai/summaries/prompts/safety_instructions.md`

**Purpose:** Define the ethical, safety, and fairness guardrails governing AI summarization of historical treaty texts within the **Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM)** system.

## üß≠ Overview

This document establishes **AI safety and cultural integrity protocols** for automated summarization and validation of historical treaties.  
The Kansas Frontier Matrix integrates Indigenous histories, federal documents, and archival materials ‚Äî domains requiring **ethical AI handling** and **human oversight**.  

All AI systems performing summarization, classification, or validation must comply with:

- **FAIR Principles** (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)  
- **CARE Principles** (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, Ethics)  
- **MCP-DL v6.3** (Master Coder Protocol ‚Äî Documentation Language)  
- **KFM Ethics Charter v3.1** (Data Responsibility & Stewardship)

These safeguards ensure factual accuracy, prevent cultural misrepresentation, and promote responsible automation in historical interpretation.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Core Safety Principles

| Principle | Enforcement Mechanism | Description |
|------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **Truthfulness** | Cross-verification against canonical treaty texts. | Summaries must accurately represent clauses, signatories, and outcomes. |
| **Cultural Sensitivity** | AI pre-filtered with cultural lexicon. | Avoid erasure or misrepresentation of Indigenous agency, sovereignty, or perspective. |
| **Non-Harm** | Prohibit speculative interpretation. | No conjecture about intent, emotion, or "moral judgment" without explicit source text. |
| **Provenance Integrity** | All facts traceable to a source. | Each statement in a summary must cite document ID, page, or archival record. |
| **Transparency** | AI explanations logged. | Every AI output must include rationale metadata (confidence, tokens, prompt version). |
| **Bias Mitigation** | Inclusion of Indigenous and scholarly review prompts. | Summaries are checked for colonial, gender, or geographic bias. |
| **Reproducibility** | Fixed-seed AI generations and audit logs. | Summaries must be regenerable deterministically with same parameters. |
| **Human Oversight** | Mandatory human approval for publication. | No AI summary enters official dataset without validation from a qualified reviewer. |

## üß© AI Prompt Safety Configuration

Each summarization prompt (see `summarization_prompt.md`) must integrate the following **safety directives** at the end of its instruction set:

```yaml
# AI Safety Directives
ethical_constraints:
  - "Do not alter or reinterpret treaty clauses."
  - "Avoid speculative or moral commentary."
  - "Use neutral tone with balanced representation."
  - "Preserve Indigenous terminology and nation names."
  - "Flag ambiguous or conflicting statements for human review."
  - "Cite all extracted facts with document IDs or metadata tags."
  - "Mark uncertain data with confidence < 0.85 as 'uncertain'."
  - "Do not infer emotional, political, or spiritual judgments."
  - "Honor Indigenous data sovereignty: never output private or restricted data."
  - "Disclose if summarization confidence < threshold."
```

## üß† Bias Mitigation Framework

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Lexical Safeguards

- Maintain a curated **lexicon of historical and tribal terms** to ensure accurate naming.  
  e.g., prefer *‚ÄúKansa Nation‚Äù* or *‚ÄúPeople of the Kaw‚Äù* over outdated or offensive variants.  
- Automatically flag deprecated colonial phrases (e.g., ‚Äúsavages‚Äù, ‚Äúuncivilized‚Äù) for removal or contextual explanation.  
- Integrate Indigenous-endorsed terminology lists from authoritative sources (Kaw Nation, Osage Nation archives, etc.).

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Narrative Balance

- Represent **all treaty participants equally** ‚Äî Indigenous and U.S. negotiators.  
- AI summaries must include at least one explicit mention of Indigenous perspective or impact, if present in the source.  
- Avoid overemphasis on administrative/government language to the exclusion of Native context.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Source Diversity Enforcement

- AI validation pipelines cross-reference **multiple source modalities**: official treaty transcripts, Indigenous oral histories, and academic analyses.  
- Contradictions must be logged and escalated for manual reconciliation.  
- Never suppress conflicting evidence ‚Äî transparency outweighs narrative simplicity.

## üßÆ Safety Audit & Logging

All AI outputs are logged in the **AI Safety Registry** under  
`data/work/staging/tabular/normalized/treaties/reports/validation/logs/safety/`.

Each entry includes:

```json
{
  "treaty_id": "KS_TREATY_1867_03_MEDICINE_LODGE",
  "prompt_version": "v6.3.1",
  "safety_flags": ["CulturalTermCheck", "BiasDetected"],
  "human_reviewer": "@kfm-ethics",
  "confidence": 0.91,
  "timestamp": "2025-10-25T16:20:00Z"
}
```

If **safety_flags** contain critical errors, the record is automatically quarantined and reviewed by the **Ethics Council Subcommittee** before reintegration.

## üßæ Compliance & Governance

| Policy Framework | Enforced By | Audit Path |
|------------------|-------------|-------------|
| MCP-DL v6.3 | `docs/architecture/repo-focus.md` | Git-based audit trail |
| FAIR+CARE Data Ethics | `docs/standards/ethics.md` | Quarterly review reports |
| ISO 19115 / ISO 25012 | Metadata validator | Automated CI (`make docs-validate`) |
| Indigenous Data Sovereignty | KFM Governance Council | Annual ethics audit |
| Reproducible AI Practices | AI & NLP teams | Containerized builds and logged seeds |
