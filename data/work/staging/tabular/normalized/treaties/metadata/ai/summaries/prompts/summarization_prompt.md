# üß† Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **AI Summarization Prompt Template for Treaty Texts**  
`data/work/staging/tabular/normalized/treaties/metadata/ai/summaries/prompts/summarization_prompt.md`

**Purpose:** Define the standardized **prompt schema**, **instruction set**, and **metadata structure** for AI models generating human-readable treaty summaries in the **Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM)**.  
This prompt template ensures reproducible, ethical, and context-aware summarization aligned with **MCP-DL v6.3** and **FAIR+CARE** standards.

## üß≠ Overview

This document defines the **canonical summarization prompt** used by all KFM AI pipelines (`src/nlp/summary_generator.py`).  
It governs how language models convert raw treaty text into structured, culturally balanced summaries.

Goals:
- Guarantee **factual accuracy** and **cultural neutrality** in treaty summarization.  
- Maintain **semantic alignment** with the CIDOC CRM ontology and OWL-Time intervals.  
- Enforce deterministic, reproducible outputs (seeded inference).  
- Integrate with **AI Reviewer Prompts** for validation and bias detection.  
- Document all inputs, outputs, and context metadata for traceability under **MCP-DL v6.3**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prompt Structure Schema

```yaml
prompt_id: "TREATY_SUMMARY_V6_3_STANDARD"

## üß© Instruction Hierarchy

Each summarization prompt has three sections:

1. **Header Context Block** ‚Äî defines dataset, ontology, and ethical constraints.  
2. **Summarization Task** ‚Äî the main prompt to the AI model.  
3. **Output Template** ‚Äî JSON schema for structured storage and downstream analysis.

### Example Full Prompt Template (As Delivered to Model)

```yaml
# === HEADER CONTEXT ===
You are a historical language model specializing in treaty document summarization.
Your task is to summarize text from the Kansas Frontier Matrix archive while preserving
historical accuracy, Indigenous representation, and provenance traceability.

Follow the FAIR+CARE principles and MCP-DL v6.3 standards.

# === TASK PROMPT ===
Summarize the following treaty text faithfully:

"{{TREATY_TEXT}}"

### Your Summary Must:
1. Identify key treaty metadata:
   - Treaty name and canonical identifier.
   - Date signed, ratified, and enacted.
   - Primary location (geocoordinates if available).
   - All parties (U.S., tribal nations, representatives).
2. Describe main clauses, terms, and implications succinctly.
3. Capture Indigenous perspectives or recorded reactions if present.
4. Avoid conjecture, modern reinterpretation, or moral language.
5. Include a brief ‚ÄúImpact Summary‚Äù describing long-term outcomes when explicitly mentioned.

# === OUTPUT TEMPLATE (JSON + TEXT) ===
{
  "treaty_id": "{{TREATY_ID}}",
  "title": "{{TREATY_NAME}}",
  "date_signed": "{{YYYY-MM-DD}}",
  "location": "{{PLACE_NAME}}",
  "signatories": ["{{NAME_1}}", "{{NAME_2}}"],
  "clauses": [
    {"section": 1, "summary": "Transfer of specified lands..."},
    {"section": 2, "summary": "Guarantee of annuities..."}
  ],
  "impact_summary": "The treaty marked the relocation of several tribes and established Fort X.",
  "indigenous_perspective": "Records from the Kaw Nation describe the treaty as...",
  "confidence": 0.94,
  "source_refs": ["treaty_ocr_1867_pg3", "archive_khs_0214"]
}
```
