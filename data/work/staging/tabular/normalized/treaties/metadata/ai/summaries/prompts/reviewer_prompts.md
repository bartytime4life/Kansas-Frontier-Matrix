## üß≠ Overview

The **AI Reviewer Prompt Framework** defines all *automated and human-assisted validation instructions* for treaty summary assessment.  
It ensures summaries meet high scientific and ethical standards of **accuracy, interpretive neutrality, and provenance traceability**, consistent with MCP-DL v6.3.  
Prompts are applied in both *automated batch validation* and *manual human review* to guarantee robust audit trails.

## üß© Purpose and Scope

| Category | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Objective** | Define the structure and semantics of prompts guiding AI models and human reviewers to assess treaty summaries. |
| **Scope** | All normalized treaty metadata under `data/work/staging/tabular/normalized/treaties/` generated via AI summarization pipelines. |
| **Primary Users** | AI validators, human historians, MCP compliance reviewers, and continuous integration bots (`stac-validate.yml`, `ai-review.yml`). |
| **Output Target** | `data/work/staging/tabular/normalized/treaties/reports/validation/reports/summary_reviews/*.json` |
| **Dependencies** | CIDOC CRM ontology, OWL-Time alignment, Neo4j graph schema (`src/graph/schema.cql`) |
| **Review Frequency** | Every 90 days or post-model-update. |

## üß† Core Reviewer Prompt Set

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Factual Accuracy Review
```text
Compare the AI-generated treaty summary to canonical text and metadata.

Check:
- Major facts (date, signatories, parties) are preserved.
- No fabricated or omitted content.
- Chronology is accurate and consistent.

Output: reasoning, verdict {PASS|FAIL|PARTIAL}, confidence score.
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Semantic Clarity Review
```text
Assess clarity, readability, and logical flow of the summary.

Ask:
- Is the text coherent and accessible to a general academic audience?
- Are clauses and cause‚Äìeffect relationships logically ordered?
- Rate clarity on 1‚Äì5 scale and provide one improvement note.
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Entity Linking Validation
```text
Verify named entities correspond to canonical graph nodes.

- Each PERSON, PLACE, or TRIBE entity must link to a Neo4j node ID.
- Identify missing or mislinked entities.
- Return verdict {PASS|PARTIAL|FAIL}.
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Historical Alignment
```text
Validate the temporal and geographic alignment.

- Check that described events fall within verified OWL-Time intervals.
- No anachronisms or geographical inconsistencies.
- Ensure CIDOC CRM alignment for Event ‚Üí Place ‚Üí Time relationships.
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Bias and Representation
```text
Evaluate tone and representation for historical neutrality.

- Does the summary treat all parties equitably?
- Detect colonial bias, omission of Indigenous agency, or loaded phrasing.
- Verdict: "Balanced" | "Skewed" | "Inadequate".
```

## üìà Validation Metrics & Thresholds

| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| **Accuracy Agreement Rate** | % of summaries validated as factually correct | ‚â• 95% |
| **Entity Linking Precision** | Correctly linked entities / total | ‚â• 0.90 |
| **Temporal Alignment Score** | Agreement with OWL-Time chronology | ‚â• 0.92 |
| **Bias Detection Recall** | Biased samples correctly flagged | ‚â• 0.85 |
| **Clarity Rating Mean** | Avg. human readability score | ‚â• 4.5 / 5 |

---

## üß© Data Provenance & Governance

All reviewer prompts, results, and verdicts are logged under the **Governance Ledger** with SHA-256 checksums and contributor attribution.  
This supports **traceable AI validation**, in line with MCP-DL‚Äôs **Scientific Method Chain**:

| Step | Artifact | Format | Location |
|------|-----------|---------|----------|
| Prompt Definition | `reviewer_prompts.md` | Markdown | `/metadata/ai/summaries/prompts/` |
| Model Output | `summary.json` | JSON | `/summaries/output/` |
| Validation Result | `review.json` | JSON | `/reports/validation/reports/` |
| Audit Record | `ledger.json` | JSON-LD | `/governance/ledger/` |

---

## üîç FAIR+CARE Alignment

| Principle | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Findable** | All prompts indexed in STAC metadata and searchable via MCP API. |
| **Accessible** | Public under CC-BY 4.0; linked to treaty metadata catalog. |
| **Interoperable** | Structured YAML/JSON schema aligns with DCAT and schema.org/CreativeWork. |
| **Reusable** | Prompts parameterized for reuse in other datasets. |
| **Collective Benefit (CARE)** | Ensures Indigenous representation is ethically reviewed. |
