## üß≠ Overview

This document defines **review prompts** that both AI agents and human historians use to evaluate the integrity and interpretive quality of treaty summaries in KFM.  
Each prompt targets a distinct *validation dimension*‚Äîaccuracy, clarity, entity linkage, chronology, and bias neutrality‚Äîensuring reproducible, ethical validation within the MCP-DL framework.

## üß† Reviewer Prompts

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Factual Accuracy
```text
Compare the AI-generated summary to the canonical treaty text.

Checklist:
- Dates, signatories, and clauses match original records.
- No fabricated or omitted content.
- Chronological order aligns with historical metadata.

Output: reasoning, verdict {PASS|FAIL|PARTIAL}, confidence score.
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Semantic Clarity
```text
Assess readability and flow.

- Language is clear, concise, and neutral.
- Logical progression from context ‚Üí event ‚Üí impact.
- Rate clarity (1‚Äì5) and suggest improvement in one line.
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Entity Linking
```text
Validate named entity consistency with graph nodes.

- Confirm each PERSON, PLACE, and GROUP maps to Neo4j node IDs.
- Identify alias errors or missing entities.
- Verdict {PASS|PARTIAL|FAIL} with missing list.
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Historical Alignment
```text
Check temporal/geographic consistency.

- Event fits within validated OWL-Time interval.
- Geography matches historical map layers.
- Detect anachronisms or misplaced entities.
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Bias and Representation
```text
Evaluate neutrality and representation.

- Balanced portrayal of all parties.
- Detect colonial or ethnocentric bias.
- Verdict: "Balanced" | "Skewed" | "Inadequate".
```

## üìà Validation Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Target |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Accuracy Agreement** | % of factual matches confirmed by reviewers | ‚â• 95% |
| **Entity Linking Precision** | Correctly resolved entities / total mentions | ‚â• 0.90 |
| **Temporal Consistency** | Event-time conformity to OWL-Time | ‚â• 0.92 |
| **Bias Detection Recall** | Detected biased samples / total biased samples | ‚â• 0.85 |
| **Readability Score (avg)** | Mean clarity rating by reviewers | ‚â• 4.5 |

## üßæ Governance & Provenance

| Artifact | Format | Location |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Reviewer Prompts | Markdown | `/metadata/ai/summaries/prompts/` |
| Summary Outputs | JSON | `/metadata/ai/summaries/output/` |
| Review Logs | JSON | `/reports/validation/reports/` |
| Audit Trail | JSON-LD | `/governance/ledger/` |

All outputs are registered with the **Governance Ledger** and verified via SHA-256 hashes.  
This ensures MCP-DL audit compliance and FAIR+CARE traceability for each reviewed artifact.

---

## üîç FAIR+CARE Compliance

| Principle | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Findable** | Indexed via STAC + DCAT metadata. |
| **Accessible** | Openly available under CC-BY 4.0. |
| **Interoperable** | Uses standardized JSON/YAML schemas. |
| **Reusable** | Parameterized prompts reusable in other domains. |
| **Collective Benefit (CARE)** | Includes fairness evaluation to preserve Indigenous representation. |
