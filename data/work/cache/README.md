## üìö Overview

The `data/work/cache/` directory serves as a **temporary storage layer**  
for cached intermediate datasets, downloaded assets, and re-usable results generated during ETL or analysis.  

Caching improves pipeline performance by:
- Reducing redundant network requests (e.g., repeated data downloads)  
- Minimizing computational overhead by reusing processed intermediates  
- Supporting reproducible, restartable ETL runs without recomputation  

All cache contents are **automatically generated**, **excluded from version control**, and **safe to delete**.  
They can be fully **reconstructed deterministically** through pipeline execution.

## üóÇÔ∏è Directory Layout

```bash
data/work/cache/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ terrain/                 # Cached DEM tiles and hillshade intermediates
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hydrology/               # Cached flowline, flood, or basin shape downloads
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ climate/                 # Cached precipitation and temperature NetCDF data
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ landcover/               # Cached NLCD and crop mask assets
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tabular/                 # Cached CSV/Parquet files from repeated fetch operations
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ text/                    # Cached OCR or NLP preprocessing results

> **Note:** Cached files mirror the KFM data domain structure to maintain consistency
> and are regenerated automatically as needed during ETL runs.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage Guidelines

| Policy                  | Description                                                                          |
| :---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ephemeral Caching**   | Files are temporary and excluded from version control.                               |
| **Performance Focused** | Cache enables faster ETL iteration by reusing intermediate results.                  |
| **Reproducibility**     | Cached data must be regenerable via `make` or pipeline scripts.                      |
| **Automatic Expiry**    | Cache is cleared during full rebuilds or after successful pipeline runs.             |
| **CI/CD Exclusion**     | This folder is ignored by continuous integration except for performance diagnostics. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Typical Use Cases

| Task                      | Example                                                             |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Terrain Processing**    | Store DEM tiles and mosaics fetched from USGS 3DEP for reuse.       |
| **Hydrology ETL**         | Cache NHD flowline and WBD basin data to avoid redundant downloads. |
| **Climate Data Handling** | Temporarily retain large NetCDF grids from Daymet or NOAA.          |
| **Land Cover Analysis**   | Cache NLCD or USDA CDL data tiles for repeated sampling.            |
| **Text Processing**       | Hold OCR-preprocessed or tokenized corpora for NLP re-use.          |
| **Tabular QA**            | Cache cleaned but unvalidated CSV/Parquet files for later checks.   |

---

## üßπ Cleanup Policy

Cache contents are routinely purged to ensure reproducibility and prevent disk bloat.

**Makefile target:**

```bash
make clean-cache
```

**Manual cleanup:**

```bash
rm -rf data/work/cache/*
```

To rebuild all pipelines from a clean slate:

```bash
make rebuild-all
```

> **Tip:** Removing cache files will increase ETL runtime temporarily but ensures full reproducibility.

## üß© Integration with KFM Pipelines

| Linked Component      | Purpose                                                             |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `src/pipelines/*`     | Uses cache to store temporary intermediate data between ETL stages. |
| `data/work/tmp/`      | Works in tandem with `/tmp/` for ephemeral processing.              |
| `.github/workflows/*` | Cache ignored in CI/CD except for ETL timing diagnostics.           |
| `data/checksums/`     | Final outputs validated independently of cache files.               |

## üß† MCP Compliance Summary

| MCP Principle           | Implementation                                                   |
| :---------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Documentation-first** | README clearly defines structure, purpose, and cleanup.          |
| **Reproducibility**     | Cached data always regenerable via deterministic pipelines.      |
| **Open Standards**      | Only open formats (GeoTIFF, CSV, JSON, Parquet, NetCDF).         |
| **Provenance**          | Cached outputs align directly with ETL logs and source datasets. |
| **Auditability**        | Cache access logged via pipeline logging for transparency.       |
