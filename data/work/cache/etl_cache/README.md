# ‚öôÔ∏è Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **ETL Cache Layer**
`data/work/cache/etl_cache/README.md`

**Purpose:** Temporary cache for intermediate data transformations and validation checkpoints produced during ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflows.  
Ensures reproducibility, computational efficiency, and full FAIR+CARE-compliant traceability in the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM) data pipeline architecture.

## üìö Overview

The `data/work/cache/etl_cache/` directory is used for **storing transient, intermediate ETL outputs** generated during data transformation, validation, and quality assurance workflows.  
It improves efficiency by reusing partial results instead of reprocessing entire datasets, while maintaining full lineage and governance integrity.

### ETL Cache Functions:
- Stores partially transformed GeoJSON, CSV, and Parquet files during pipeline runs.  
- Holds schema validation summaries and normalization context.  
- Enables checkpoint recovery for large-scale ETL workflows.  
- Ensures deterministic transformations via checksum verification.

All cached files are **non-archival** and are automatically cleared upon workflow completion or after 72 hours.

## ‚öôÔ∏è ETL Cache Workflow

    A["Raw Data (data/raw/*)"] --> B["Transformation Pipeline (src/pipelines/etl/)"]
    B --> C["Intermediate Cache (data/work/cache/etl_cache/)"]
    C --> D["Validation and FAIR+CARE Review"]
    D --> E["Final Output to data/work/tmp/ or data/work/processed/"]
    E --> F["Governance Logging (audit and manifest)"]
```

### Description:
1. **Transformation:** Raw data undergoes normalization and schema alignment.  
2. **Cache Write:** Intermediate results saved temporarily for later reuse or inspection.  
3. **Validation:** Cached results validated against STAC/DCAT metadata schemas.  
4. **Export:** Cleaned, validated datasets exported to processed workspace.  
5. **Governance:** Cache entries logged in provenance ledger for reproducibility.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Common Cache Formats

| Format | Use Case | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Parquet (.parquet)** | Large, columnar ETL transformations (hazards, climate). | `hazards_etl_cache.parquet` |
| **JSON (.json)** | Schema validation context and summary data. | `validation_context.json` |
| **CSV (.csv)** | Lightweight intermediate datasets. | `etl_preview.csv` |
| **Feather (.feather)** | Tabular data exchange between Python pipelines. | `etl_temp_cache.feather` |

All cache files adhere to open data standards for transparency and interoperability.

---

## üß† FAIR+CARE Compliance in ETL Cache

| Principle | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Findable** | Metadata and manifest entries generated per cache artifact. |
| **Accessible** | Cache data accessible to workflow processes only (non-public). |
| **Interoperable** | Stored in interoperable open formats (Parquet, JSON, CSV). |
| **Reusable** | Metadata includes checksums and pipeline provenance for reproducibility. |
| **Collective Benefit** | Improves data pipeline efficiency and governance traceability. |
| **Authority to Control** | Cache governed by internal ETL system workflows. |
| **Responsibility** | Logs ensure cache creation and deletion are traceable. |
| **Ethics** | Contains no sensitive or user-specific data. |

Compliance validated in `data/reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json`.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Governance & Provenance Integration

| Record | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `metadata.json` | Defines cache runtime context, pipeline reference, and checksum. |
| `data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json` | Records cache creation, validation, and purge events. |
| `data/reports/validation/schema_validation_summary.json` | Contains validation status for cached schema checks. |
| `releases/v9.3.2/manifest.zip` | Global checksum registry for reproducibility. |

Cache governance linked through the **ETL pipeline controller** under  
`src/pipelines/etl/etl_controller.py`.

---

## üßæ Retention Policy

- **Default TTL:** 72 hours from creation timestamp.  
- **Cleanup Trigger:** Executed automatically after successful ETL completion.  
- **Cache Exclusions:** Files marked with `"retain": true` in metadata persist through next session.  
- **Governance Record:** All cache lifecycle events logged for audit purposes.
