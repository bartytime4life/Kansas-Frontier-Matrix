# 📑 Kansas Frontier Matrix — **Reports & Governance Artifacts**
`data/reports/README.md`

**Purpose:**  
Central repository for **validation reports, FAIR+CARE audits, AI explainability logs, and governance records** within the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
This layer ensures accountability, reproducibility, and transparency across all KFM data workflows, providing verified documentation for ethics, provenance, and certification audits.

## 📚 Overview

The **Reports Layer** functions as KFM’s official audit trail and accountability hub.  
All validations, governance actions, AI model audits, and FAIR+CARE ethics assessments are stored here for regulatory compliance, open-data certification, and reproducibility assurance.

### Core Responsibilities
- Maintain **validation and FAIR+CARE audit reports** for all KFM domains.  
- Archive AI explainability and bias audit results.  
- Register and verify provenance entries in the Governance Ledger.  
- Provide dashboards for quarterly FAIR+CARE and sustainability reporting.

## ⚙️ Validation & Publication Workflow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["ETL Validation Outputs (data/work/tmp/*/validation/)"] --> B["Schema & Checksum Verification"]
    B --> C["FAIR+CARE Ethics Certification (data/reports/fair/*)"]
    C --> D["Governance Ledger Registration (data/reports/audit/*)"]
    D --> E["Sustainability Metrics Update (data/reports/sustainability/*)"]
```

### Workflow Description
1. **Validation:** Schema and checksum reports generated post-ETL.  
2. **Certification:** FAIR+CARE ethics compliance evaluated for transparency.  
3. **Governance:** Results logged in the immutable data provenance ledger.  
4. **Sustainability:** Energy and carbon reports generated for ISO 14064 compliance.
