# üßÆ Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Audit & Provenance Ledger**
`data/reports/audit/README.md`

**Purpose:** Defines the audit, provenance, and integrity verification framework for the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM) data repository.  
Tracks dataset lineage, transformation history, checksum integrity, and governance decisions for every data asset.

## üìö Overview

The `data/reports/audit/` directory functions as the **governance and provenance backbone** of the Kansas Frontier Matrix data architecture.  
It maintains **verifiable records** of all datasets, their transformations, and ethical governance approvals through immutable JSON logs.

Each audit file:
- Records dataset lineage from ingestion to archival.  
- Stores digital checksums for reproducibility.  
- Logs FAIR+CARE governance reviews and sign-offs.  
- Links back to STAC catalog items, manifests, and schema validation results.  

Together, these files form the **Data Provenance Ledger**, ensuring that every dataset in KFM can be traced, verified, and ethically justified.

## üß© Governance Workflow

    A["ETL Pipeline or Data Update"] --> B["Validation and FAIR and CARE Compliance"]
    B --> C["Checksum Generation and Verification"]
    C --> D["Governance Review and Approval"]
    D --> E["Audit Ledger Update (data/reports/audit/)"]
    E --> F["Ledger Sync with Releases and STAC Catalog"]
```

### Description:
1. **ETL or AI job completion** triggers validation and checksum generation.  
2. FAIR+CARE Council reviews ethical and technical conformance.  
3. Governance signatures are appended to the audit ledger.  
4. The ledger entry is locked and propagated to:
   - `releases/v9.3.2/manifest.zip`
   - `data/stac/catalog.json`
   - `reports/fair/data_fair_summary.json`

## ‚öôÔ∏è FAIR+CARE Governance Integration

| Principle | Implementation in Audit System |
|------------|-------------------------------|
| **Findable** | Ledger entries are indexed and searchable through dataset IDs. |
| **Accessible** | All JSON logs are published openly in the repository. |
| **Interoperable** | Uses JSON-LD and STAC-compatible fields for linkage. |
| **Reusable** | Each entry provides complete provenance metadata. |
| **Collective Benefit** | Promotes transparent and ethical use of public data. |
| **Authority to Control** | FAIR+CARE Council authorizes all governance approvals. |
| **Responsibility** | Data managers sign off on accuracy and compliance. |
| **Ethics** | Each dataset includes an ethical context note and review. |

---

## üß© Integrity & Verification

Each dataset‚Äôs checksum is verified automatically via:
- `sha256sum` comparison across ETL outputs  
- `archive_integrity_log.json` entries  
- Cross-reference with `releases/v9.3.2/manifest.zip`  

Checksum validation ensures:
- Immutable, tamper-proof archival datasets  
- Continuous verification across CI/CD pipelines  
- Long-term reproducibility in future research  

---

## üßæ Governance Linkages

The audit ledger connects to multiple governance components:
- `reports/fair/data_fair_summary.json` ‚Äî FAIR+CARE scores  
- `reports/validation/stac_validation_report.json` ‚Äî Schema and metadata compliance  
- `docs/standards/governance/` ‚Äî Governance framework  
- `schemas/telemetry/work-data-governance-v14.json` ‚Äî Telemetry schema for audit tracking  

All provenance data is cross-referenced in the Neo4j Knowledge Graph for traceability in Focus Mode and archival queries.
