## üìö Overview

The `data/reports/fair/` directory contains all **FAIR+CARE validation outputs**, **ethical compliance assessments**, and **council reviews** for KFM datasets.  
These reports quantify the project‚Äôs commitment to **open data**, **ethical AI**, and **transparent data governance**.

Each file:
- Documents dataset compliance with FAIR+CARE standards.  
- Records metrics used for council review and governance dashboards.  
- Links validation outcomes to corresponding datasets, manifests, and audit ledgers.  
- Is generated automatically by `.github/workflows/faircare-validate.yml`.

    A["Dataset Validation Completed"] --> B["FAIR Metrics Evaluation (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)"]
    B --> C["CARE Assessment (Collective Benefit, Authority, Responsibility, Ethics)"]
    C --> D["Generate FAIR and CARE Reports"]
    D --> E["Governance Council Review and Ledger Update"]
```

### Process Steps:
1. **FAIR Evaluation** ‚Äî Automated checks for metadata completeness, schema compliance, and STAC discoverability.  
2. **CARE Assessment** ‚Äî Manual and automated review of ethical, governance, and community-related factors.  
3. **Scorecard Generation** ‚Äî Consolidated quantitative metrics written to `faircare_scorecard.csv`.  
4. **Governance Review** ‚Äî Council validates findings, signs off, and updates `data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json`.

|-----------|---------|--------------|--------|---------|
| **FAIR** | `findable_score` | Metadata completeness and search indexing | 0‚Äì100 | `data_fair_summary.json` |
| **FAIR** | `accessible_score` | Openness and license compliance | 0‚Äì100 | `data_fair_summary.json` |
| **FAIR** | `interoperable_score` | Schema alignment and cross-dataset linkages | 0‚Äì100 | `data_fair_summary.json` |
| **FAIR** | `reusable_score` | Provenance and documentation quality | 0‚Äì100 | `data_fair_summary.json` |
| **CARE** | `collective_benefit_score` | Community and societal value | 0‚Äì100 | `data_care_assessment.json` |
| **CARE** | `authority_to_control_score` | Ownership and governance balance | 0‚Äì100 | `data_care_assessment.json` |

## üß© Governance & Provenance Integration

All FAIR+CARE reports link to:
- `data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json` ‚Äî Provenance and governance ledger  
- `data/reports/validation/stac_validation_report.json` ‚Äî Schema and STAC validation reference  
- `releases/v9.3.2/manifest.zip` ‚Äî Checksums and data signatures  
- `docs/standards/faircare-validation.md` ‚Äî Evaluation rubric and methodology  

Governance validation workflows:
- `.github/workflows/faircare-validate.yml`  
- `.github/workflows/governance-ledger.yml`  

---

## üß† FAIR+CARE Council Oversight

The **FAIR+CARE Council** performs quarterly reviews of these reports to:
- Identify datasets that need ethical or metadata improvements.  
- Approve inclusion in public releases and STAC catalogs.  
- Issue ethical compliance certificates for qualifying datasets.  

Their reviews are documented in:
- `ethics_review_summary.md`  
- `audit/data_provenance_ledger.json`
