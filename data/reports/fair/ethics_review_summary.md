## üìö Overview

The **Ethics Review Summary** consolidates governance findings from quarterly FAIR+CARE audits.  
Each review cycle covers:
- Data ethics and community engagement outcomes.  
- Model bias analysis and explainability audits.  
- Provenance and consent verification.  
- Compliance with KFM‚Äôs **Master Coder Protocol (MCP-DL v6.4.3)** and governance charter.  

Ethics reports derive from automated FAIR+CARE validation workflows (`faircare-validate.yml`) and human-led reviews by the FAIR+CARE Council.

  C --> D["Community and Indigenous Data Stewardship Checks"]
  D --> E["Governance Decision Logging"]
  E --> F["Ethics Review Summary Publication"]
```

**Steps:**
1. **Submission:** New datasets or model updates trigger automated FAIR+CARE validation.  
2. **Council Review:** The FAIR+CARE Council evaluates ethical context, provenance, and license compliance.  
3. **Cultural Review:** Indigenous and community data reviewed under CARE principles.  
4. **Decision Log:** Results (approved/flagged/pending) stored in `data/reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json`.  
5. **Publication:** Findings summarized in this report for public transparency.
