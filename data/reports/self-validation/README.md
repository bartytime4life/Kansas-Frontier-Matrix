# 🧮 Kansas Frontier Matrix — Self-Validation Reports  
`data/reports/self-validation/README.md`

**Purpose:**  
Provide a centralized reference for **autonomous, continuous validation outputs** generated by  
KFM’s internal QA processes. These reports support **reproducibility, governance integrity,  
FAIR+CARE alignment**, and automated model/data monitoring across all pipelines.

</div>

---

## 📘 Overview

The **Self-Validation Layer** automatically evaluates every dataset and model produced by the  
Kansas Frontier Matrix. It provides:

• Schema conformance checks  
• Checksum and provenance verification  
• FAIR+CARE internal compliance scoring  
• AI ethics checks (bias, drift, explainability consistency)  
• Metadata completeness checks  
• Telemetry v11 (energy, carbon, record throughput)  
• Automated governance ledger updates  

Self-validation ensures that all KFM outputs remain trustworthy, reproducible, and aligned  
with the system’s ethical and technical governance standards.

---

## 📂 Directory Layout

The directory contains autonomous validation results for each data domain:

• README.md (this file)  
• work-climate-validation.json  
• work-hazards-validation.json  
• work-hydrology-validation.json  
• work-landcover-validation.json  
• work-spatial-validation.json  
• work-tabular-validation.json  
• self-validation-summary.json  

Each JSON file represents a complete autonomous validation cycle for its domain.

---

## 🧩 Validation Categories

Self-validation evaluates:

• Schema correctness and metadata structure  
• Checksum integrity and reproducibility  
• FAIR metadata completeness and clarity  
• CARE stewardship and governance readiness  
• Licensing validity and openness  
• Spatial/temporal consistency  
• AI drift, bias, and explainability compliance  
• Accessibility indicators  
• Telemetry v11 resource metrics

## ⚖️ FAIR+CARE Alignment

Self-validation contributes to FAIR+CARE by ensuring:

Findable  
• All artifacts registered in STAC/DCAT catalogs.  

Accessible  
• Open, machine-readable JSON outputs with metadata.  

Interoperable  
• Uses ISO-19115, DCAT 3.0, PROV-O, KFM metadata conventions.  

Reusable  
• Provenance complete; checksums verified; license validated.  

Collective Benefit  
• Automated QA increases dataset reliability.  

Authority to Control  
• Governance Council oversees release and promotion.  

Responsibility  
• Pipelines check drift, bias, and explainability each cycle.  

Ethics  
• Ethical concerns are flagged prior to publication or narrative use.  

---

## 🌱 Sustainability Metrics

Telemetry v11 fields include:

• energy_wh  
• carbon_gco2e  
• renewable_power  
• records_processed  
• runtime_seconds  

These values support environmental accountability and sustainable compute policies.
