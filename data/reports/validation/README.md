# ‚úÖ Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Data Validation Reports**
`data/reports/validation/README.md`

**Purpose:** Central repository for schema conformance, STAC validation, and ETL quality assurance reports generated during the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM) data lifecycle.  
Ensures reproducibility, transparency, and FAIR+CARE compliance for all validated datasets.

## üìö Overview

The `data/reports/validation/` directory stores all **validation artifacts** created during data ingestion, ETL transformation, and governance review.  
These reports verify that every dataset adheres to defined metadata schemas, spatial standards, and FAIR+CARE governance requirements.

Each report provides:
- Structural and semantic validation of data (GeoJSON, GeoTIFF, CSV).  
- STAC 1.0 and DCAT 3.0 schema verification.  
- Error, warning, and success logs from automated validation tools.  
- Cross-checks between dataset metadata and governance manifests.

### Description:
1. **STAC Validation:** Confirms presence of mandatory fields, valid geometries, and metadata structure.  
2. **Schema Validation:** Checks attribute integrity, CRS consistency, and metadata schema compliance.  
3. **AI Validation:** Ensures derived models meet data accuracy, drift, and bias metrics.  
4. **FAIR+CARE Validation:** Cross-links metadata and ethical standards before publishing.  
5. **Governance Review:** Reports sent to the FAIR+CARE Council for audit and archival.

## üß© Validation Tools and Standards

| Tool | Purpose | Output |
|------|----------|---------|
| **stac-validator** | Checks dataset conformance to STAC 1.0 | `stac_validation_report.json` |
| **jsonschema** | Validates JSON-based metadata and schemas | `schema_validation_summary.json` |
| **GDAL / ogrinfo** | Confirms geospatial data validity and CRS consistency | `geojson_schema_validation.log` |
| **AI Drift Monitor** | Detects data drift and model inconsistencies | `ai_validation_metrics.csv` |

---

## üîç Example ‚Äî STAC Validation Report

```json
{
  "dataset": "hazards_v9.3.2",
  "status": "passed",
  "validator_version": "1.1.0",
  "errors": [],
  "warnings": ["Recommended field 'keywords' missing"],
  "metadata_completeness": 0.98,
  "linked_items": [
    "data/stac/items/hazards_v9.3.2.json",
    "reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json"
  ]
}
```

> ‚úÖ **Note:** Each STAC report references the dataset‚Äôs provenance record and manifest for traceability.

## üß† FAIR+CARE Validation Criteria

| Validation Type | FAIR Principle | CARE Principle | Description |
|------------------|----------------|----------------|--------------|
| Metadata Schema | Findable | Responsibility | Ensures complete, searchable metadata. |
| File Format | Accessible | Collective Benefit | Verifies open, non-proprietary formats. |
| CRS / Geometry | Interoperable | Authority to Control | Checks coordinate system and feature validity. |
| Provenance Chain | Reusable | Ethics | Links all derived data to verified origins. |

All results are aggregated and scored in the **FAIR+CARE governance dashboard** located in:  
`data/reports/fair/faircare_scorecard.csv`

---

## üßæ Validation Metrics Example (AI)

```csv
dataset_id,accuracy,f1_score,drift_index,validation_status
hazards_v9.3.2,0.92,0.91,0.02,passed
climate_v9.3.2,0.89,0.87,0.05,passed
treaties_v9.2.0,0.99,0.99,0.00,passed
```

These metrics are incorporated into the **AI governance ledger** under:  
`data/reports/audit/ai_hazards_ledger.json`

---

## üßæ Governance Integration

Validation reports directly feed into:
- `data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json` ‚Äî Logs validation results and governance approvals.  
- `data/reports/fair/data_fair_summary.json` ‚Äî FAIR scoring aggregation.  
- `releases/v9.3.2/manifest.zip` ‚Äî Includes validation summaries for each dataset.  
- `.github/workflows/stac-validate.yml` ‚Äî Automated validation workflow trigger.

Governance sign-offs by FAIR+CARE Council members are appended to validation reports before merging to main.
