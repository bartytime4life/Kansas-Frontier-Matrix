# üõ†Ô∏è Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **FEMA Mitigation Projects**
`data/raw/fema/mitigation_projects/README.md`

**Purpose:** Contains unmodified datasets from FEMA‚Äôs **OpenFEMA Mitigation Projects** catalog, documenting hazard mitigation and disaster recovery efforts in Kansas.  
These datasets form the foundation for resilience assessment, infrastructure recovery analytics, and FAIR+CARE-compliant project governance within the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).

## üìö Overview

The `data/raw/fema/mitigation_projects/` directory houses datasets describing **FEMA-funded mitigation projects** across Kansas, including project types, costs, and hazard categories.  
These records are drawn from the FEMA OpenFEMA API (v2) and are maintained in raw CSV format to ensure provenance integrity.

Each dataset:
- Is sourced directly from FEMA‚Äôs public Open Data API.  
- Contains records of approved, active, and closed mitigation projects.  
- Is accompanied by complete metadata for governance and validation.  
- Serves as a primary reference for KFM‚Äôs resilience modeling pipelines.

    C --> D["Immutable Storage in data/raw/fema/mitigation_projects/"]
    D --> E["Transformation and FAIR and CARE Validation"]
```

### Workflow Details:
1. Data fetched via OpenFEMA API query filtered for Kansas projects.  
2. Metadata file generated with source URL, schema fields, and ingestion date.  
3. SHA-256 checksums generated and stored in manifest.  
4. Raw CSV stored unaltered; FAIR+CARE audit confirms provenance and accessibility.
