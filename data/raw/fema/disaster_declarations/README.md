## üìö Overview

The `data/raw/fema/disaster_declarations/` directory includes all FEMA disaster declaration summaries from 1953 to 2025.  
These data represent official federal disaster declarations (DR, EM, FM codes) and contain incident information, declaration types, affected counties, and fiscal years.  

All datasets are:
- Downloaded directly from the **FEMA OpenFEMA API (v2)**.  
- Stored in raw CSV format for transparency and provenance retention.  
- Accompanied by metadata describing schema, checksum, and source URL.  
- Validated and logged within KFM‚Äôs FAIR+CARE governance framework.

### Description:
1. **Ingestion:** Automated nightly ingestion from FEMA OpenFEMA endpoint.  
2. **Metadata:** Created automatically with `source_url`, `record_count`, and temporal range.  
3. **Checksum:** SHA-256 hash generated for file integrity validation.  
4. **Validation:** Ensures data completeness, schema compliance, and FAIR+CARE governance.
