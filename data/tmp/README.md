# Kansas-Frontier-Matrix â€” `data/tmp/` (Ephemeral Temporary Files)

This folder is reserved for **purely transient artifacts** â€” files created during builds, tests, or experiments  
that **do not belong in version control** and can be safely deleted at any time.

It acts as a scratchpad for pipelines, fetchers, and experiments so canonical data directories (`raw/`, `processed/`, `cogs/`, `derivatives/`) remain clean.

---

## Purpose

- Provide a writable sandbox for scripts and Makefile targets.  
- Hold downloads, unzipped archives, or intermediate exports that will be discarded after use.  
- Prevent clutter or accidental pollution in reproducible directories.  
- Serve as a **pipeline buffer**: e.g., temporary mosaics before COG conversion, OCR scratch text, clipped shapefiles before reproject.  

---

## Rules

- ðŸš« **Never commit files in `data/tmp/`.**  
  - This directory is excluded by `.gitignore`.  
  - CI jobs ignore its contents entirely.  

- âœ… If a temporary file proves useful, **promote it**:  
  - â†’ `data/work/` if it is an intermediate worth tracking short-term.  
  - â†’ `data/processed/` or `data/cogs/` if it is analysis-ready.  
  - â†’ `data/raw/` if it is a canonical upstream input.  
  - Update **STAC Items** and **provenance** if promoted.  

- ðŸ§¹ Everything here is **safe to delete** â€” scripts and Makefile rules must regenerate outputs as needed.  

---

## Typical Contents

- Temporary raster/vector conversions before COG/GeoJSON promotion.  
- Cache files from fetch scripts or API queries.  
- Zipped archives extracted mid-pipeline.  
- Test exports, thumbnails, or draft images.  
- Partial OCR text dumps during document processing.  
- Scratch shapefiles or clipped regions for inspection.

## Connections in Data Lifecycle

This folder sits at the **lowest rung** of the data lifecycle:

tmp/  â†’  work/  â†’  processed/ | cogs/  â†’  derivatives/  â†’  stac/

- `tmp/` â†’ ephemeral, ignored, wipeable.  
- `work/` â†’ semi-scratch, tracked if reproducibility is valuable.  
- `processed/` & `cogs/` â†’ validated, canonical inputs.  
- `derivatives/` â†’ reproducible analysis outputs.  
- `stac/` â†’ metadata catalog for discovery, versioning, and lineage.

## Usage Examples

### DEM pipeline scratch
```bash
# Mosaic raw tiles before creating a final COG
gdal_merge.py -o data/tmp/ks_mosaic_2018.tif data/raw/elevation/tiles/*.tif
rio cogeo create data/tmp/ks_mosaic_2018.tif data/cogs/dem/ks_1m_dem_2018.tif

OCR scratch

# Store intermediate OCR text here, not in processed/
tesseract data/raw/docs/treaty_osage_1825.pdf data/tmp/treaty_osage_1825 -l eng

Makefile Integration

Add tmp as a safe build target:

clean-tmp:
\trm -rf data/tmp/*

.PHONY: clean-tmp

CI pipelines can call make clean-tmp after runs to prevent accumulation.

Provenance & STAC Connections
	â€¢	No provenance or STAC entries are required for files in data/tmp/.
	â€¢	If promotion happens, immediately:
	â€¢	Compute checksum (scripts/gen_sha256.sh)
	â€¢	Add an entry to data/provenance/registry.json
	â€¢	Create/update the relevant STAC Item (data/stac/items/**.json)

â¸»

âœ… Summary:
Use data/tmp/ for anything transient and disposable.
If a file becomes important â†’ promote and document it; otherwise, let it vanish.
