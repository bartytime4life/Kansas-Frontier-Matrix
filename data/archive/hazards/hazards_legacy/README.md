# üï∞Ô∏è Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Hazards Legacy Archive**
`data/archive/hazards/hazards_legacy/README.md`

**Purpose:** Preserves early (pre-FAIR+CARE) Kansas hazard datasets maintained for reference, provenance continuity, and historical reproducibility.  
These files represent legacy geospatial integrations prior to the adoption of full MCP-DL v6.3 documentation and FAIR+CARE governance workflows.

## üìö Overview

The `hazards_legacy/` directory stores historical hazard datasets from the **pre-FAIR+CARE governance era (2015‚Äì2023)**.  
These files capture early spatial integrations of flood, tornado, drought, and seismic data that served as foundational material for subsequent validated releases.

While not governed by the same MCP-DL documentation and validation standards as newer releases, all legacy datasets were retroactively reviewed for:
- Provenance continuity and checksum verification.  
- License and attribution consistency.  
- Spatial accuracy and coordinate system alignment.  
- Ethical compliance via retrospective FAIR+CARE audit (2025).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Legacy Workflow (Historical Context)

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Raw NOAA and FEMA Data (2015‚Äì2020)"] --> B["Manual GIS Integration (ArcMap / QGIS)"]
    B --> C["Preliminary Validation (Schema and Projection)"]
    C --> D["Legacy Archive (data/archive/hazards/hazards_legacy)"]
    D --> E["Retrospective FAIR and CARE Review (2025)"]
```

**Historical Notes:**
- Prior to 2023, hazard datasets were integrated manually using ArcMap and QGIS.  
- FAIR+CARE principles were later applied retroactively using the 2025 governance schema.  
- Coordinate systems and boundaries were normalized to **EPSG:4326** during review.

| Principle | Result | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| **Findable** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Metadata incomplete; identifiers reconstructed from historical manifests. |
| **Accessible** | ‚úÖ Open | Files licensed under CC-BY 4.0 and made public. |
| **Interoperable** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Some legacy GeoJSON files missing STAC metadata. |
| **Reusable** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited | Documentation and provenance partially reconstructed. |
| **Collective Benefit** | ‚úÖ Met | Retained for transparency and research continuity. |
| **Authority to Control** | ‚úÖ Met | Source attribution confirmed (NOAA, FEMA, USGS). |
| **Responsibility** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Lacked automated QA; ethics review added post-hoc. |
| **Ethics** | ‚úÖ Passed | No sensitive or personal data found in review. |

## üßæ Migration Manifest Example

```json
{
  "legacy_file": "hazards_2020.geojson",
  "migrated_to": "data/archive/hazards/hazards_v9.0.0/hazards_combined_2023.geojson",
  "migration_notes": "Legacy schema updated to STAC 1.0 format; added bounding box and license metadata.",
  "checksum_verified": true,
  "governance_reviewed_by": "@kfm-data-lab",
  "review_date": "2025-03-10T12:00:00Z"
}
```

> üîç These mappings ensure continuity between pre-FAIR+CARE and standardized datasets for long-term reproducibility.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Governance and Provenance

| Governance Element | Reference |
|---------------------|------------|
| **Retrospective Review Report** | `data/reports/audit/archive_integrity_log.json` |
| **Migration Manifest** | `data/archive/hazards/hazards_legacy/migration_manifest.json` |
| **Ethical Audit Log** | `data/reports/fair/ethics_review_summary.md` |
| **Checksum Log** | `releases/v9.0.0/manifest.zip` |

Legacy records are kept immutable under archival governance policy to preserve data lineage.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Ethical Context Statement

> These legacy hazard datasets are preserved **for transparency and research reproducibility only**.  
> They may contain methodological inconsistencies due to pre-standardization processing workflows.  
> All datasets were reviewed in 2025 and deemed ethically safe for public release.  
> Users are encouraged to reference updated versions (v9.2.0 or later) for operational or analytical use.
