# üìú Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Treaties Legacy Archive**
`data/archive/treaties/treaties_legacy/README.md`

**Purpose:** Contains pre-FAIR+CARE digitized treaty and land cession datasets compiled before MCP-DL standardization.  
Retained for transparency, historical continuity, and reproducibility in treaty mapping and archival research.

## üìö Overview

The `treaties_legacy/` directory preserves early digitizations of Indigenous treaties and land cessions in Kansas.  
These files were generated before the implementation of full FAIR+CARE and Indigenous Data Sovereignty governance frameworks.

**Key Historical Details:**
- Derived from early GIS digitization efforts (1980s‚Äì2010s).  
- Data manually compiled from historical maps and textual sources.  
- Retrospectively reviewed under FAIR+CARE audit in 2025.  
- Retained for transparency, provenance continuity, and reference in future treaty editions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Historical Workflow (Pre-MCP Standardization)

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Archival Scans and Paper Maps (1970s‚Äì1990s)"] --> B["Manual GIS Digitization (1980s‚Äì2010s)"]
    B --> C["Legacy Data Compilation (CSV and SHP Formats)"]
    C --> D["Preliminary FAIR Review (2020)"]
    D --> E["Retrospective FAIR and CARE Audit (2025)"]
```

**Notes:**
- Original shapefiles lacked standardized metadata or CRS references.  
- FAIR+CARE Council retroactively added metadata and provenance links.  
- Coordinate reference system updated to **EPSG:4326 (WGS84)** for interoperability.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Cultural & Ethical Context

> These legacy materials are preserved to ensure transparency in the digitization of treaty records and recognition of historical methodologies.  
> While early processing workflows lacked modern governance standards, KFM has confirmed the data contains no culturally restricted or proprietary content.  
> The FAIR+CARE Council approved public access under CC-BY 4.0 to support research and education.
