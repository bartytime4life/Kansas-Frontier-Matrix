# üìú Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Historical Climate Archive (1900s)**
`data/archive/climate/climate_historical_1900s/README.md`

**Purpose:** Preserves early 20th-century Kansas climate datasets (1900‚Äì1999) derived from NOAA, NCEI, and USHCN records.  
Serves as a foundational, pre-FAIR+CARE resource for historical temperature, precipitation, and drought data across Kansas.

## üìö Overview

The `climate_historical_1900s/` directory contains **legacy climate data** from the early Kansas weather observation records.  
These datasets were compiled prior to the implementation of MCP-DL documentation and FAIR+CARE compliance, but were retrospectively reviewed and annotated for preservation integrity.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Covers temperature and precipitation observations between **1900‚Äì1999**.  
- Compiled from NOAA, NCEI, and Kansas Mesonet archives.  
- Converted from shapefiles and CSVs into modern GeoJSON format.  
- Reviewed for ethical and metadata completeness in 2025.

### Notes:
- Data originally digitized from paper logs and scanned maps between 2010‚Äì2015.  
- Georeferenced manually using early QGIS workflows.  
- Retrospectively validated for metadata completeness and spatial accuracy.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Historical Importance

> These legacy datasets represent the earliest digitized collections of Kansas climate data.
> They have been preserved for:
> - Transparency and lineage continuity.  
> - Comparative analysis with modern climate datasets.  
> - Educational and archival value under FAIR+CARE stewardship.  
>
> Although pre-standardization, these files serve as a testament to the evolution of open data ethics in KFM‚Äôs research methodology.
