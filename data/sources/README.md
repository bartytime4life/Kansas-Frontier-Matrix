# üîó Kansas Frontier Matrix ‚Äî **Data Source Index**
`data/sources/README.md`

**Purpose:** Serves as the master registry for all external data sources ingested into the Kansas Frontier Matrix (KFM).  
Each JSON file within this directory describes a unique data provider, access method, license, and governance metadata to ensure reproducibility, traceability, and FAIR+CARE compliance.

## üìö Overview

The `data/sources/` directory functions as the **centralized catalog of data origins** for all KFM raw datasets.  
It provides a standardized framework for documenting:
- Data provider information (institution, contact, API endpoints)  
- License and access rights  
- Provenance metadata and FAIR+CARE alignment  
- Temporal and spatial coverage of datasets  
- Validation and governance linkage  

This directory ensures that every dataset ingested into KFM maintains verifiable provenance and transparency under the **Master Coder Protocol (MCP-DL v6.3)**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Governance Workflow

flowchart TD
    A["External Data Source (e.g., NOAA, USGS, FEMA, NARA)"] --> B["Metadata Definition (data/sources/*.json)"]
    B --> C["FAIR+CARE Review and Governance Tagging"]
    C --> D["Ingestion to data/raw/"]
    D --> E["ETL Validation and Provenance Logging"]
    E --> F["STAC Catalog Integration"]
```

### Description:
1. **Metadata Definition:** Each source is represented as a structured JSON file defining access URLs, license, and schema.  
2. **FAIR+CARE Review:** Governance validation ensures open data compliance and ethical stewardship.  
3. **Ingestion:** Data pulled automatically from defined sources using authenticated or public APIs.  
4. **Provenance Logging:** Source IDs linked to governance ledger and manifest.  
5. **STAC Integration:** All metadata indexed under the STAC catalog for discoverability.

## üß† FAIR+CARE Compliance Integration

| Principle | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Findable** | Indexed through STAC and manifest with unique provider IDs. |
| **Accessible** | Metadata openly available under permissive licensing. |
| **Interoperable** | JSON schema adheres to DCAT 3.0 / STAC 1.0 standards. |
| **Reusable** | Includes provenance, license, and access details. |
| **Collective Benefit** | Ensures open reuse for research and public benefit. |
| **Authority to Control** | Source organizations retain ownership and attribution. |
| **Responsibility** | Governance Council verifies data accuracy and ethics. |
| **Ethics** | Sources reviewed for transparency and open-access alignment. |

Governance metadata and validation reports stored in:  
- `data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json`  
- `data/reports/fair/data_fair_summary.json`

## üîç Governance Integration

| Record | Purpose |
|---------|----------|
| `data/reports/audit/data_provenance_ledger.json` | Tracks ingestion, validation, and source linkage. |
| `data/reports/fair/data_care_assessment.json` | FAIR+CARE compliance and ethics audit results. |
| `releases/v9.3.2/manifest.zip` | Checksum validation for all registered source datasets. |
