# 🧭 Kansas Frontier Matrix — **Processed Data Repository**
`data/processed/README.md`

**Purpose:** Contains the standardized, interoperable data outputs generated by the Kansas Frontier Matrix ETL pipelines.  
Each dataset here is a post-processed, FAIR+CARE-certified product ready for use in analysis, visualization, or public dissemination.

## 📚 Overview

The `data/processed/` directory serves as the **canonical layer** for all data products derived from raw sources after validation, transformation, and enrichment by the KFM ETL pipelines.  
All files adhere to open, machine-readable formats (GeoJSON, Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF, CSV, JSON-LD) with complete metadata and provenance links.

### Core Functions

- **Normalization:** Converts raw and intermediate data into interoperable standards (e.g., GeoTIFF for rasters, GeoJSON for vectors).  
- **Governance Readiness:** Includes checksum, lineage, and validation reports compliant with FAIR+CARE and Master Coder Protocol.  
- **Discoverability:** Indexed in the [STAC Catalog](../../data/stac/catalog.json) for spatial and temporal search.  
- **Interoperability:** Fully DCAT-3 and CIDOC CRM aligned for cross-domain data exchange.

## 🗂️ Directory Layout

```plaintext
data/processed/
├── climate/              # Processed climate and environmental layers (GeoTIFF, CSV)
├── hazards/              # Tornadoes, floods, drought indices, and related GIS overlays
├── hydrology/            # Water flow, river networks, groundwater and floodplain data
├── landcover/            # Vegetation, soil, and historical land use classifications
├── treaties/             # Digitized and geocoded treaty boundaries and metadata
├── archives/             # Derived text and OCR-based datasets from KHS and Library of Congress
├── tabular/              # Cleaned CSV tables (e.g., census or demographic summaries)
├── validation/           # Quality and lineage reports for datasets in this directory
└── README.md             # This document
```

Each subfolder contains self-descriptive metadata (`.json` or `.yml`) accompanying each dataset, detailing its lineage, license, version, checksum, and related sources.

## ⚙️ Data Standards and Formats

| Data Type | Standard Format | Example File | Description |
|------------|----------------|---------------|--------------|
| Raster (Gridded) | Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) | `elevation_1880_cog.tif` | Elevation, soil, or satellite-derived layers optimized for web access |
| Vector (Spatial) | GeoJSON / TopoJSON | `railroads_1875.geojson` | Boundaries, transportation, land parcels, treaty polygons |
| Tabular | CSV / JSON | `census_1860_clean.csv` | Structured tabular data linked by geospatial or temporal attributes |
| Textual | JSON-LD / Markdown | `treaty_metadata.jsonld` | Linked narrative or document-derived entities (OCR + NLP results) |
| Metadata | STAC / DCAT JSON | `collection_treaties.json` | Dataset description for catalog discovery and integration |

> ⚙ **Tip:** Each dataset in this directory is linked to its STAC Item in `data/stac/collections/` for metadata consistency and automated validation.

## 🧩 FAIR+CARE & Governance Integration

All processed datasets undergo validation according to the **FAIR+CARE** principles:

| Principle | Implementation | Artifact |
|------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Findable** | Indexed via STAC/DCAT JSON in `data/stac/` | `collection_*.json` |
| **Accessible** | Stored in open formats, retrievable via HTTPS or repo clone | GeoTIFF, GeoJSON |
| **Interoperable** | Schema aligned with GeoJSON, OWL-Time, CIDOC CRM | Metadata files |
| **Reusable** | Licensed under CC-BY 4.0 with full provenance | `metadata.json` |
| **Collective Benefit (CARE)** | Indigenous data governance and attribution included | Treaty datasets |
| **Authority to Control** | Sources and interpretations are attributed | Metadata entries |
| **Responsibility** | Data validation reports and audits published | `reports/validation/*.json` |
| **Ethics** | Sensitive data flagged, reviewed by FAIR+CARE council | Governance ledger |

---

## 🧮 Validation and Provenance

Each dataset is accompanied by validation artifacts:

- **Checksum Verification:** SHA-256 recorded in manifest files.  
- **Schema Validation:** JSON Schema validation for metadata and data structure.  
- **STAC Validation:** Ensures alignment with STAC v1.0.0 specification.  
- **Governance Sync:** All updates are logged to the Immutable Governance Ledger (`reports/audit/governance-ledger.json`).  

Example provenance snippet:

```json
{
  "source": "NOAA GHCN-Daily",
  "processed_on": "2025-11-04",
  "checksum_sha256": "e47b45f19f3d5a...",
  "validated_by": "checksum_validate.yml",
  "governance_hash": "a2d3f19b1dca...",
  "license": "CC-BY 4.0"
}
```

## 🔗 Linkages and Semantic Integration

Processed datasets are semantically linked through the knowledge graph and ontologies:

- **Spatial Entities:** `geo:hasGeometry` → Links to places or features.  
- **Temporal Extents:** `time:hasBeginning` / `time:hasEnd` → Connects with OWL-Time intervals.  
- **Provenance:** `prov:wasGeneratedBy` → Pipeline or ETL process identifiers.  
- **Cultural Context:** `crm:E7_Activity` / `crm:P7_took_place_at` for events and treaty layers.  

All metadata includes a JSON-LD context for direct RDF export compatibility.
